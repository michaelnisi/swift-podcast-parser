			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode was originally released on August 18, 2022. In this encore presentation, host Reed Galen is joined by author, journalist, and QAnon expert Mike Rothschild to discuss how the QAnon conspiracy theory grew to be in the forefront of American political discourse, why it resonated so fervently with such a large percentage of the population, and how it continues to infect our nation’s culture today. Plus, is there a prescription to get the QAnon devout to “snap out of it” and denounce the conspiracy? For more on this, be sure to pick up Mike Rothschild’s latest book, The Storm Is Upon Us: How QAnon Became a Movement, Cult, and Conspiracy Theory of Everything, now available in paperback.<br /> If you’d like to connect with The Lincoln Project, send an email to podcast@lincolnproject.us.</p>]]></description>
