      <title>Episode 410: The Murder of Sophie Toscan du Plantier</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Just two days before Christmas in 1996 the body of 39 year old, french filmmaker, wife, daughter and mother Sophie Toscan Du Plantier was found not far from her vacation home.

This was a classic tale of a tight knit community that was absolutely shocked, terrified and deeply saddened by this heinous crime. Unfortunately the investigation was a shaky one which led to two countries and families arguing back and forth. In the end, even though someone <em>was</em> convicted, there were still doubts and no one has been put behind bars to serve a sentence for Sophie’s murder.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you to the glorious David White for research assistance on this case!</p><p><br></p><p>References</p><p>Coulter, Carol. 2003.

      <title>Episode 389: The Murder of Ali Kamel Fahmy Bey</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Marguerite Alibert was a woman set on getting what she wanted out of life. She was raised a very poor girl and was sent away from her family at a very young age to go and live with the Sisters of Mary. When she became pregnant at 16 and lost the job they had set up for her she was left all alone in the world and had to turn to sex work to make a living. She ended up being one of the most popular and desired courtesans in Paris, but that reputation would not remain spotless for long.

      <itunes:summary>Marguerite Alibert was a woman set on getting what she wanted out of life. She was raised a very poor girl and was sent away from her family at a very young age to go and live with the Sisters of Mary. When she became pregnant at 16 and lost the job they had set up for her she was left all alone in the world and had to turn to sex work to make a living. She ended up being one of the most popular and desired courtesans in Paris, but that reputation would not remain spotless for long. Soon Marguerite, after scamming multiple men… like Prince Edward VIII, would meet a young Egyptian “Prince.” Their life was set up to be picture perfect, but all was not as it seemed. Just six months into their marriage, one of them would end up murdered.

      <title>Episode 383: The Framing of Kelli Peters</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>For this episode of Morbid Ash has a bit of a different tale for us. This is the case of Kelli Peters; a mom, the PTA president, and framed woman. The afternoon of February 17th 2010 started off so normal for Kelli. She pulled into the school she’d been volunteering at for years and started getting to work with the kids. Out of nowhere, Kelli’s afternoon took a turn. She was called to the office where a police officer waited for her, and when she got there he wanted to know whether or not he could search her car. When he did he uncovered a ceramic pipe, 17 grams of pot, 11 percocet pills and 29 vicodin pills. But for the first time in probably the history of ever, the drugs really weren't Kelli’s. She had been framed. </p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>We got some spooky ass woods for you guys! Alaina tells us the tale of Robinson Woods located in Illinois. This place has a pretty heavy energy as it is both a Native American burial ground and the location of a triple homicide that took place in the 50s. Ash then takes us just outside of Mexico City to talk about Isla De Las Muñecas or The Island of the Dolls. This is where Don Julian Santana Barrera dedicated his days to making the island a peaceful sanctuary for the spirit of a young girl he once encountered.

John suffered serious injuries that left him in the ICU and unfortunately, Katie was killed in the crash. Cory Todd Foster, who has a 20 year history of vehicular crimes including DWI, reckless driving and speeding faced absolutely no charges. </p><p>A huge thank you to John Palmer for speaking to us about Katie's life and the injustice surrounding her death. </p><p>There are so many injustices in this case that will leave you infuriated, but the fight is not over.

Hollywood has always been rife with controversy and such was the case when William was found dead in his apartment, having been shot with a rare .38 caliber gun.

Was it Mabel Normand who had been at his home just minutes before he was killed, or could it have been Mary Miles Minter and her crazy Stage Mom ™ Charlotte Shelby?

      <title>Episode 343: Jack the Ripper Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Alaina takes us to the streets of Whitechapel for part one of Jack The Ripper, and boy is it a stark picture she’s painting us. Whitechapel was dark, damp, dirty and downright desolate at the time Jack The Ripper was roaming the streets.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Heidi Allen disappeared on Easter morning back in 1994 from the convenient store she’d worked at for years. Her car was still parked in the parking lot when police arrived, her purse, keys and jacket were all behind the counter and there was still money on the counter and in the register, tipping off the police that this was not a crime motivated by robbery. The police began to look into two men after receiving a few tips and were pretty sure that they had the right guys… but did they? In part two we’ll go over some new information that has been released over the years that has led to new theories. Unfortunately none of these claims have ever led to finding Heidi.

What it turned into is an epic journey through one listener's truly harrowing experience in a very haunted home. Brad gets the spotlight today as he brings us through "The happenings" in an old house on a hill. There are deaths, demonic growls, entrapments, creatures hiding in the crawlspace and straight up teleportation (we think? Let us know, Pookie). ENJOY!

      <title>Episode 330: The Tragic Murder of Savanna LaFontaine Greywind</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>Savanna LaFontaine Greywind was about to enter such an exciting time of life. She had just gotten a new job, was working on getting a new apartment with her longtime boyfriend and the two of them together were getting ready to welcome their sweet baby girl, Haisley Jo into the world. Unfortunately, two human garbage piles of muck would take Savanna's life and attempt to take her baby as well. Savanna and her family are Native American people and Savanna's story is sadly another example of how often Indigenous and Native American people, specifically women, are treated and how their stories are not covered in mainstream media. To help fight against this here are some websites with calls to action that we can all get ourselves involved in.

If you're so inclined, we thought it would be a nice sentiment to donate to any of the places available via these sites and to do so in Savanna's name</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><a href="https://indianlaw.org/safewomen" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Safe Women, Strong Nations</a></p><p><a href="https://mmiwusa.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Missing Murdered Indigenous Women</a>&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/ashton-matheny" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ashton Matheny GoFundMe</a></p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/SavannaLaFontaineGreywind" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Savanna's Memorial Facebook page</a></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <title>Episode 328: The Circleville Letter Writer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The Circleville Letter writer is a case that will absolutely baffle your brain. In 1976 one of the first letters was delivered to Mary Gillespie and it accused her of being one of the many women supposedly having an affair with the superintendent of schools, Gordon Massie. The letters would continue to be sent, not only to Mary, but to most of the residents and business owners in the town. The letter writer seemed to know everything about everyone and would stop at nothing to take down the people they thought were morally wrong…. As if sending intimidating letters across a city is a moral thing to do. By the end of this a possibly innocent man would be sent to prison, another man would end up dead and Mary would survive an attempt on her life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As always thank you to our sponsors:</p><p><br></p><p>Rothys: Discover the versatile styles you can wear absolutely anywhere and get $20 off your first purchase at rothys.com/MORBID</p><p><br></p><p>Babbel: Right now, save up to 60% off your subscription when you go toBABBEL.com/MORBID</p><p><br></p><p>Hunter Douglas: VisitHunterDouglas.com/&nbsp;morbid today for your freeStyleGets Smarter design guide with fresh takes, creative ideas and smart solutions for dressing your windows.</p><p><br></p><p>Audible: Visit Audible.com/MORBID or text MORBID to 500-500</p><p><br></p><p>Simplisafe: You can customize the perfect system for your home in just a few minutes at SIMPLISAFE.com/morbid.Go today and claim a free indoor security camera plus 20% off with Interactive Monitoring</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

&lt;br&gt;
In 1988 three college students came up with a plan to murder one of those students entire family in order to get money from a life insurance policy. Chris Pritchard, James “Bart” Upchurch and Neal Henderson all sat around for weeks on end trying to figure out the best way to kill Chris’s family and get away with it, all so that they could spend their days loafing around and not have to get real jobs or continue on with college. In the end, after multiple plans that didn’t work, only one member of Chris’s family members would end up dead; his stepfather Leith Von Stein. But who would take the fall?&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 319: The Somerton Man Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Somerton Man case is one that has confounded Australia for almost 75 years now. It all started when an unidentifiable man was found dead on Somerton Beach. The man had no wallet, no form of ID, there was no name written inside of his clothing as would have been typical for the time. And it seemed like all of this was on purpose. Things in the case only got stranger when a tiny rolled up piece of paper was found in a hidden fob pocket in the man's jacket. The words on the paper read “Tamam Shud” and were later determined to have been ripped out of a book of poetry written in the 11th century: The Rubaiyat. In part one we’ll dip our toes into the mystery and in part two Ash will be taking everyone to the deep end of the pool for a serious dive into who the heck this man could possibly be and what the heck happened to him.<br>

      <title>Episode 317: The Horrific Murder of Katy Hawelka Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It was August 1986 when Katherine “Katy” Hawelka started her second year at Clarkson University. She was 19 years old and looking forward to the start of classes and reuniting with her college pals. As a bright, kind and hard-working young woman, she was set to set the world on fire. Her mother and sister (who was her best friend) dropped her off on campus and after settling in Katy went out with some friends. Unfortunately Katy would never make it to the start of classes. Her precious life she would cut short when she was brutally attacked and sexually assaulted by a monster named Brian McCarthy.<br>
<br>

Please consider signing this petition to keep Brian McCarthy from receiving parole. Katy's family has to go before the board every 24 months to keep their daughter's killer behind bars:<br>
<br>


<a href="https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/petiton-to-deny-parole-for-brian-m-mccarthy.html" target="_blank">Petition to Deny Parole for Brian M. McCarthy</a> <br>
<br>

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>317</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>It was August 1986 when Katherine “Katy” Hawelka started her second year at Clarkson University. She was 19 years old and looking forward to the start of classes and reuniting with her college pals. As a bright, kind and hard-working young woman, she was set to set the world on fire. Her mother and sister (who was her best friend) dropped her off on campus and after settling in Katy went out with some friends. Unfortunately Katy would never make it to the start of classes. Her precious life she would cut short when she was brutally attacked and sexually assaulted by a monster named Brian McCarthy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Please consider signing this petition to keep Brian McCarthy from receiving parole. Katy's family has to go before the board every 24 months to keep their daughter's killer behind bars:&lt;br&gt;

      <description>
        <![CDATA[In part one we learned about the circumstances surrounding Dorothy Arnold’s disappearance. By all means it just seemed like she went out for a day of shopping and then disappeared into thin air. In part 2 Alaina delivers some theories that have been visited over the past hundred years and we both come to our own conclusion on what the heck happened to Dorothy Arnold. What’s your conclusion?<br>

      <itunes:summary>In part one we learned about the circumstances surrounding Dorothy Arnold’s disappearance. By all means it just seemed like she went out for a day of shopping and then disappeared into thin air. In part 2 Alaina delivers some theories that have been visited over the past hundred years and we both come to our own conclusion on what the heck happened to Dorothy Arnold. What’s your conclusion?&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 314: The Mysterious Disappearance of Dorothy Arnold Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Dorothy Arnold was a 25 year-old New York socialite from a prominent family back in 1910. One day, in broad daylight on fifth avenue, she seemingly vanished into thin air. No evidence, no packed bags and nothing to say what happened to her. Her family took some weird steps in the days and months after her disappearance all in the name of keeping their social standing. This is really just a case that makes you go, “hmmm…” And it's just the beginning. <br>

      <title>Episode 313: The Unsolved Murder of Bonny Lee Bakley</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
<br>
Bonny Lee Bakley’s life is rife with controversy, chaos and just straight up tragedy. She was born into an incredibly toxic environment and seemed to go through life looking for some sense of purpose. She was married multiple times, but her last marriage to actor Robert Blake was the one that added the most controversy. The couple was married only about 5 months when Bonny was murdered on the night of May 4th 2001. Immediately Robert was looked into as a suspect and eventually brought to trial for her murder but the mystery reamins to this day. Who killed Bonny Lee Bakley?

      <title>Episode 312: Matthew Hoffman AKA The Leaf Killer Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[When we left off in part one, Matthew Hoffman had tied Sarah Maynard up so that he could take a nap after brutally killing three of her loved ones. Part two picks up with Matthew clean up the scene while keeping Sarah locked in his cold, dark basement where she was left to sit on a makeshift bed made from, you guessed it....leaves. While Matthew was working on the rest of his plan, like burning down the home, the police were working behind the scenes and luckily able to rescue Sarah. <br>
<br>
Case begins at 11mins 30 seconds because we had a philosophical discussion about not letting toxic shit into your bubble. We understand some people may want to skip! :)<br>
<br>
Check out this amazing book about the case!<br>

      <title>Episode 311: Matthew Hoffman AKA The Leaf Killer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Matthew John Hoffman was a strange guy. He was in a constant flux of being a quiet, yet unassuming guy to then having bouts of strange and off-putting behavior. It was his love of trees that gave him comfort and seemed to keep him settled at times, but on November 9, 2010 he broke into a quiet home in Apple Valley, Ohio, brutally taking the lives of Tina Hermann, her 11 year old son Kody and her best friend Stephanie Sprang, before leaving with 13 year old Sarah Maynard in his clutches. <br>
<br>
Soon, Hoffman's obsession with trees would become the defining piece of this killer's pathology. In Part 1, we discuss his puzzling history, the lives of Tina, Kody and Stephanie, and the house of horrors he brought Sarah back to. <br>
<br>

      <itunes:title>Matthew Hoffman AKA The Leaf Killer</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>311</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Matthew John Hoffman was a strange guy. He was in a constant flux of being a quiet, yet unassuming guy to then having bouts of strange and off-putting behavior. It was his love of trees that gave him comfort and seemed to keep him settled at times, but on November 9, 2010 he broke into a quiet home in Apple Valley, Ohio, brutally taking the lives of Tina Hermann, her 11 year old son Kody and her best friend Stephanie Sprang, before leaving with 13 year old Sarah Maynard in his clutches. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Soon, Hoffman's obsession with trees would become the defining piece of this killer's pathology. In Part 1, we discuss his puzzling history, the lives of Tina, Kody and Stephanie, and the house of horrors he brought Sarah back to. &lt;br&gt;

      <title>Your Magic presents Satanism</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In this episode, we present to your earholes some beautiful, whimsical and wonderful friends of the pod Your Magic. <br>
<br>
Today, Your Magic pulls back the curtain on the many misconceptions about Satanism. Exploring demon conjurings (spoiler...they can be kinda cute!) and the beef between the Temple of Satan and the Church of Satan. Meeting three different types of Satanists- atheistic, theistic and satanic witches- we mostly learn that the devil is our friend. Plus, we dive into the meaning of The Devil card with Hannah Graves, creator of Cult Mother Tarot, learning how to work with its dark and disciplinary energy.  <br>
<br>
Your Magic is a podcast hosted by author Michelle Tea. Every episode explores contemporary spirituality and magic with lots of humor and heart. Usually, they read their guests tarot – including people like Kathryn Hahn, Japanese Breakfast, Phoebe Bridgers, and so many other amazing people and then offer a DIY spell or ritual that anyone can do. But, in this episode – the host Michelle Tea dives deep into Satanism, the Satanic Church and the Satanic Temple and explores what it actually looks like to worship Satan.

      <title>Episode 309: The Wonderland Murders Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Wonderland Murders, or The Four on the Floor case is a case from the old days of Hollywood. It’s not the kind of old Hollywood case that Ash usually delivers, this one instead is a totally different take. The Wonderland Gang was made up of a group of people you definitely would not want to mess with, however one of the key players in this case, John Holmes did just that. He got on the bad side of the gang and had to come up with a way to get back in their good graces. Unfortunately that plan would lead to one of the most gruesome mass murders the police had seen since the Tate-LaBianca murders.<br>

      <title>Episode 307: The Grotesque Murders of Joel and Lisa Guy</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Lisa and Joel Guy Sr. were said to be loving, kind hearted and passionate people. The two of them had raised a family together and at 55 and 61 years old were ready to retire. One caveat with their plan was that they were still providing for their grown son Joel Guy Jr. They had plans to tell him that he was going to need to start supporting himself around Christmas. Unfortunately they would not be able to celebrate their next Christmas. Their only son would brutally murder them in their home on Thanksgiving weekend.<br>

        <![CDATA[Lisa and Joel Guy Sr. were said to be loving, kind hearted and passionate people. The two of them had raised a family together and at 55 and 61 years old were ready to retire. One caveat with their plan was that they were still providing for their grown son Joel Guy Jr. They had plans to tell him that he was going to need to start supporting himself around Christmas. Unfortunately they would not be able to celebrate their next Christmas. Their only son would brutally murder them in their home on Thanksgiving weekend.<br>

      <title>Episode 306: The St. Osyth Witch Trials</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
<br>
Alaina brings us the true story of the The St Osyth Witch trials this week. It all starts with a "naughty named" woman, Ursula, potentially causing the lameness of another woman called Grace. Causing the lameness of another was grounds for being charged with the very serious felony of Witchcraft, and really it all went downhill from there. In the end fourteen were accused, two were hanged and many more died in prison. <br>
<br>

      <title>Episode 302: Albert Fish Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is such a highly requested case that Alaina decided to take one for the team and dive deep into the world that was Albert Fish. Albert Fish had an incredibly abusive childhood starting from when he was 5 years old and had to be placed into an orphanage. He experienced all kinds of torture and abuse and it was there that he realized he was aroused by not only the pain he was suffering but the pain inflicted upon others. In part one we’ll cover Fish’s first crimes, including his first murder which was the brutal slaying of Francis McDonnell, an eight year old boy. <br>

        <![CDATA[This is such a highly requested case that Alaina decided to take one for the team and dive deep into the world that was Albert Fish. Albert Fish had an incredibly abusive childhood starting from when he was 5 years old and had to be placed into an orphanage. He experienced all kinds of torture and abuse and it was there that he realized he was aroused by not only the pain he was suffering but the pain inflicted upon others. In part one we’ll cover Fish’s first crimes, including his first murder which was the brutal slaying of Francis McDonnell, an eight year old boy. <br>

She would tell anyone who would listen that she wanted to be a star and no one doubted her ability to get there. Christa moved out to Hollywood to make it big, and while she had some success along the way, the biggest story surrounding Christa would be her murder. Unfortunately Christa’s murder still remains unsolved but it is a wild ride trying to make sense of it all!<br>

      <title>Episode 299: The Horrific Murder of Dorothy Eggers</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[When Arthur Eggers walked into the police station to report his wife Dorothy missing, there were a few things about his story that just didn’t quite add up. He had her height off by about 5 inches and he said he was reporting her missing even though he knew she most likely ran off with a truck driver (!!!!) The police were quite concerned though, because they had an unidentified, HEADLESS body, and now they were thinking it could be Arthur’s wife. This tale will take you on so many different rides, you know what to do. Hold on. To. Your. Butts and potentially your food coloring. <br>

      <itunes:title>The Horrific Murder of Dorothy Eggers</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>299</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>When Arthur Eggers walked into the police station to report his wife Dorothy missing, there were a few things about his story that just didn’t quite add up. He had her height off by about 5 inches and he said he was reporting her missing even though he knew she most likely ran off with a truck driver (!!!!) The police were quite concerned though, because they had an unidentified, HEADLESS body, and now they were thinking it could be Arthur’s wife. This tale will take you on so many different rides, you know what to do. Hold on. To. Your. Butts and potentially your food coloring. &lt;br&gt;

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Gather round weirdos, lend an ear and get HELLA STOKED because we got the chance to sit down with the creators and stars of the latest Scream!! In this episode we’re not only joined by Radio Silence’s Tyler Gillett, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Chad Villella, but with legacy cast member David Arquette and the insanely talented new star Melissa Barrera who stars in the latest film. We got to ask them about the creation of the film, David shares a fond memory with the one and only Wes Craven and we got to hear their thoughts on some burning questions we had for the future of the franchise. Hold onto your butts, and never run up the stairs instead of going out the front door… It's insulting.<br>

      <title>Episode 298: The Murder of Abraham Shakespeare</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In November of 2006 a man named Abraham Shakespeare won the lottery jackpot worth $31 million. Abraham was known as a generous, kind man who would do anything to help his friends, family or children out. Unfortunately a cold-blooded, manipulative woman by the name of Dee Dee Moore would make the acquaintance of Abraham Shakespeare and swindle him out of his millions. Before long, people stopped hearing from Abraham, and some feared the worst. Was he murdered or simply trying to get away from the pressure of it all?<br>

      <title>Episode 297: James Rodney Hicks Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
<br>
We know you have been waiting for the conclusion to this horrific tale, and here it is. James Rodney Hicks destroyed the lives of everyone he came in contact with, but unfortunately he was slipping through the cracks at every turn. Now, armed with decades worth of information and a thirst for justice, Detective Ricker joins forces with a new investigator to take Hicks down once and for all. But not before gruesome details are revealed that would disturb even the most seasoned of detectives.<br>
<br>

Check out this amazing book on the case: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-North-Woods-Murders-James-ebook/dp/B00XRCXSCU" target="_blank">Tragedy In The North Woods by Trudy Irene<br>
</a><br>

Also, this is an amazing podcast series on this case, including a discussion with Detective Ricker. <a href="https://www.murdershetold.com/episodes/1-james-hicks" target="_blank">Murder She Told</a> (Also this pod is just really great in general!)<br>

&lt;br&gt;
We know you have been waiting for the conclusion to this horrific tale, and here it is. James Rodney Hicks destroyed the lives of everyone he came in contact with, but unfortunately he was slipping through the cracks at every turn. Now, armed with decades worth of information and a thirst for justice, Detective Ricker joins forces with a new investigator to take Hicks down once and for all. But not before gruesome details are revealed that would disturb even the most seasoned of detectives.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

Check out this amazing book on the case: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-North-Woods-Murders-James-ebook/dp/B00XRCXSCU" target="_blank"&gt;Tragedy In The North Woods by Trudy Irene&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Also, this is an amazing podcast series on this case, including a discussion with Detective Ricker. &lt;a href="https://www.murdershetold.com/episodes/1-james-hicks" target="_blank"&gt;Murder She Told&lt;/a&gt; (Also this pod is just really great in general!)&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 296: James Rodney Hicks Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In 1977 Jennie Hicks seemingly vanished from her home in Carmel Maine, leaving her two children behind with her husband James Hicks... at least that was James’ story. Those who knew Jennie were adamant that there was no way she would have left her children, especially not with her husband who was known to physically abuse her. When law enforcement didn’t seem interested in actually investigating Jennie’s disappearance that left James free to do as he pleased, and a few years later would leave another young mother missing and presumed dead. <br>

      <title>Episode 295: The Mary Morris Murders</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Mary Morris Murders, as they’re often referred to, are some of the most baffling murders that we’ve come across thus far. Two women, both named Mary Morris were murdered in Houston Texas just days apart from each other. The first woman Mary Lou Henderson Morris didn’t have an enemy in the world but was found murdered in one of the most gruesome manners possible. When Mary McGinnis Morris was found murdered just days later people thought that these cases must be connected. For the last 22 years, no one has been able to decide on an outcome.

      <title>Episode 293: Where is Brandon Swanson? Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Brandon Swanson was 19 years old when he went missing in the state of Minnesota. He had been out earlier that night and gone to a couple of parties before making his way home to Marshall, Minnesota. Unfortunately, on the way home, he ran into a bit of car trouble when his car veered a bit off the side of a gravel road and got stuck in a ditch. He called his parents for help and explained exactly where he was but when they got there Brandon was nowhere to be seen and neither was his car. This case is truly one of the most bizarre we’ve covered to date and sadly, there is a lack of any closure involved.<br>
<br>
If you or someone you know has any information about Brandon Swanson's location or disappearance, please contact:<br>

      <title>Episode 292: The Antifreeze Murders</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Stacey Castor is most often referred to as a Black Widow, but that name barely does justice when it comes to all of the pain Stacey inflicted on those around her. Both of her husbands turned up dead, one of a heart attack and the other of suicide and then years later her daughter was rushed to the hospital, mere minutes away from death herself. When the puzzle pieces started to fit together they showed an image of a deranged murderer who would stop at next to nothing to be painted as a grieving wife and mother, just down on her luck. <br>

      <title>Episode 291: The Purrington Massacre</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The story of the Purrington murders is so horrific it sounds like something out of a movie. James Purrington seemed to have plans of killing himself after suffering from what was likely undiagnosed mental illness. When one of his children brought this to the attention of their mother and his wife, he said he had no intention of killing himself at all, just typical worries about his family after a long grueling summer and a bad drought. His wife seemed to be settled for the time being, but soon almost the entire family would be found axed to death in their home, and James Purrington would be discovered lying dead on the kitchen floor. <br>

      <title>Episode 290: The Tragic Murder of Phil Hartman</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is the story of Phil Hartman and the episode is a little different than some we’ve done in the past. We all know Ash loves an “Old Hollywood” kind of case, this one while not very old at all fits under the umbrella. Phil Hartman was one of the most beloved comedians of all times, often referred to as, “The Man of 1000 voices.” When you dive into his life as a whole you find all kinds of hidden gems, like the fact that Phil had a run in with Jimi Hendrix, and so many more little anecdotes like that! Unfortunately, Phil was taken from this world far too soon and in such a horrific way. <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is the tale of Helen Ruth Spence, who grew up with the River People on The White River in Arkansas. When Helen was just 17 years old her father was shot and killed in front of her and her stepmother was beaten and assaulted by the same man. Helen had her own way of carrying out justice which landed her in and out of prison. The prisons at this time were deplorable and we don’t even know about all of the punishments Helen underwent. What we do know will shock you to your core. Helen's story is truly unlike any other.  <br>

      <title>Episode 287: The Murder of Betsy Faria Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Betsy Faria was known to her friends and family as such a beautiful soul. She had life-long friends who just loved to be around her because she always loved to have a good time and make those around her feel happy and loved. In addition to all those amazing friends, Betsy had a husband and two beautiful daughters who loved her endlessly. When she was diagnosed with Cancer all of those friends and family banded around her to make sure she had all the support she needed. One of those friends, Pam Hupp, took a special interest in taking care of Betsy. In fact, she was the last person to see Betsy alive. Not because Betsy had passed from Cancer, but because two days after Christmas on December 27, 2011, Betsy Faria was found stabbed to death in her own home.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Father, Son, House of Gucci!! That’s right baby, Ash did a deep dive into all things Gucci for this episode. Gucci as a company was founded in 1921 in Florence Italy by Guccio Gucci. Over the years the family business was passed through generations and eventually ended up solely in the hands of Maurizio Gucci. Unfortunately in 1995 Maurizio Gucci was killed by a hired hitman. Who hired said hitman? Gucci’s ex-wife Patrizia Reggiani. #AMereBowlOfLentils<br>

      <title>Episode 280: The "TallHotBlond" Murder</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Internet, a place where you can be whoever you want to be, whether it’s your true identity or an alter ego you’ve made up. For some people, this is chatting in online rooms with different screennames pretending to be their favorite character or someone they admire. In 2005 for a man named Thomas Montgomery it was darker than that. Thomas Montgomery was 46 years old when an 18-year-old under the screenname “TallHotBlond” messaged him. Instead of revealing who he truly was, Thomas pretended to be an 18-year-old marine named Tommy and the pair started their online affair. Eventually, their affair would leave someone dead and leave everyone else untangling a web of lies.<br>

In 2005 for a man named Thomas Montgomery it was darker than that. Thomas Montgomery was 46 years old when an 18-year-old under the screenname “TallHotBlond” messaged him. Instead of revealing who he truly was, Thomas pretended to be an 18-year-old marine named Tommy and the pair started their online affair. Eventually, their affair would leave someone dead and leave everyone else untangling a web of lies.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 278: William Bonin "The Freeway Killer" Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[William Bonin, who was also known as the Freeway Killer, raped and killed potentially over 36 young boys throughout his reign of terror. William had a deplorable childhood: his mother was neglectful and abusive, his father was a raging alcoholic who gambled all the families money away and his grandfather was a pedophile who sexually assaulted both William and his brothers. William’s backstory is heartbreaking, but unfortunately he did nothing to turn it around and continued the cycle of abuse, but escelated it to the nth degree.<br>

There were four young crew members on board, Mark, his pregnant wife Irene, and their two children 5-year-old Kimberly and 4-year-old John. Unfortunately on the night of September 5th somebody climbed aboard and massacred the entire family. 39 years later, this case remains unsolved and is considered Alaska’s largest mass murder. <br>

      <title>Episode 276: The Murder of Nona Dirksmeyer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Nona Dirksmeyer was just 19 years old when her boyfriend, Kevin, found her late on the afternoon of December 15, 2005. She and Kevin Jones were high school sweethearts who had been dating for 5 years. There was never anything in their relationship that would hint at Kevin having a temper or flying off the handle, but immediately all suspicion landed on him. You won’t believe how botched the crime scene was and will be shocked when you hear that the person who may have done this had been lurking in the shadows the whole time. <br>

      <title>Episode 275: Susan Monica</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Susan Monica was a farmer in her 60’s with her very own property where she raised chickens and pigs and worked on beautiful wrought iron fences. She had made it through much of her life flying under the radar. That was until one of the handymen on her farm, Robert Haney disappeared without a trace. The last anyone knew of his whereabouts was that he was living in a camper on Susan’s property. During the search for Robert, Susan told the police had something to confess- not only about Robert’s disappearance but another mans as well. She drew a map for the detectives with an “X” in the middle telling them, “That’s where you’re going to find Steve.”<br>

      <itunes:summary>Susan Monica was a farmer in her 60’s with her very own property where she raised chickens and pigs and worked on beautiful wrought iron fences. She had made it through much of her life flying under the radar. That was until one of the handymen on her farm, Robert Haney disappeared without a trace. The last anyone knew of his whereabouts was that he was living in a camper on Susan’s property. During the search for Robert, Susan told the police had something to confess- not only about Robert’s disappearance but another mans as well. She drew a map for the detectives with an “X” in the middle telling them, “That’s where you’re going to find Steve.”&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 273: The Winchester Mystery House (Separating Fact From Fiction)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Winchester Mystery House is a tale that’s been told countless times. The house is featured on tons and tons of Top 10 haunted lists and over the years the house has become the focal point of the lore. We felt it was really important to tell the story not only of the house but of the woman who created it: Sarah Pardee Winchester. There were countless details that we didn’t realize about her or the house and through our research, we really began tearing back the layers of this story! Hope you enjoy it as much as we did!<br>

      <title>Morbid Network presents: A chat with Spencer Henry &amp; Madison Reyes from OBITCHUARY(Special Episode Sneak Peek!)</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hey weirdos! We want to allow you to get to know our little family here on Morbid Network, so we decided to start a special interview series where we chat with the hosts of these handpicked shows and let you get to know why we love their guts! With these special episodes, you also get a sneak preview of their latest episode to really wet your whistle to dive into a new pod. Yes, that was a disgusting sentence but that's who we are.<br>
<br>
Today, we chat with two people who everyone deserves to know and love, Spencer Henry and Madison Reyes. We feel so lucky to have these two beautiful Luna moths on our network and their show OBITCHUARY is unlike anything you have ever allowed into your ear holes. Not only will you get scathing, hilarious and sometimes really dark obituaries, but you will also get some bizarre history and true crime tidbits along the way. They are truly delightful and you will want them to be your best friends too. <br>
We chatted about how expensive it is to tell someone you hate them in death, the cosmic way they became besties and so much more. <br>
Come on in, friends. The water is truly hilarious. <br>

We chatted about how expensive it is to tell someone you hate them in death, the cosmic way they became besties and so much more. <br>
Come on in, friends. The water is truly hilarious. <br>

        <![CDATA[In part two of The Villisca Axe Murders Alaina goes DEEP into the many suspects involved in the case. We’ve got a lot of crazy characters this time around. Turns out Josiah Moore had a mistress who was linked to one of his enemies, there’s also a detective who turns up with nefarious intentions, and finally blame gets shifted to a potential serial killer in the area. And of course to finish things off we’ll get into the haunting of the home which includes a pretty recent life threatening event.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you know true crime then you know The Villisca Axe Murders. In 1912 an entire family and two house guests were brutally killed in their sleep by a cold blooded beast. There have been a couple suspects over the years, but somehow this case remains officially unsolved. The details are spine chilling, but the case itself is one of the most fascinating. <br>

      <title>Episode 270: Jodi Arias</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander met in September of 2006 and from day one they were hooked on each other. Their relationship started getting toxic when Jodi became overly possessive and started listening in on Travis’s conversations when he was unaware. Travis broke things off with Jodi but the two of them never really stopped seeing each other, even when Jodi’s toxic behaviour was in full bloom. Unfortunately things escalated in June 2008 and Jodi murdered Travis in his own home. The details involved in this case are truly mind boggling. <br>

      <itunes:summary>Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander met in September of 2006 and from day one they were hooked on each other. Their relationship started getting toxic when Jodi became overly possessive and started listening in on Travis’s conversations when he was unaware. Travis broke things off with Jodi but the two of them never really stopped seeing each other, even when Jodi’s toxic behaviour was in full bloom. Unfortunately things escalated in June 2008 and Jodi murdered Travis in his own home. The details involved in this case are truly mind boggling. &lt;br&gt;

She undeniably touched the lives of everyone around her and truly just seemed like one of the most beautiful people inside and out.

        <![CDATA[As promised, we are talking today about the serial killer from Episode 266. In that episode, we focused on the only survivor of his crimes, Holly Dunn. Today, we take a walk through all of his crimes. 
Throughout the 80's and 90's, Angel Maturino Resendiz was one of the most brutal killers the United States had ever seen. Known by the media as the Railroad Killer, he stalked victims nears railroad tracks before brutally butchering them either next to the tracks or in their own homes. His mode of operation involved sexual assault and a gruesome amount of overkill. He moved freely between his home in Mexico and the States before finally being caught through fingerprints and SNA. After a reign of terror that was as prolific as it was terrorizing, he was fortunately coerced into turning himself into authorities in 1999.

      <title>Episode 267: The Unexplained Death of Ellen Rae Greenberg</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today Ash brings you the truly infuriating case of Ellen Greenberg. Ellen was a beautiful, caring 27 year old woman who had everything going for her. She had a great relationship with her family and friends, a  job as a first grade teacher, and plans to marry her fiance Sam in the coming months. There was no indication that Ellen was struggling with suicidal thoughts, yet somehow on January 26th 2011 when she was discovered dead on her kitchen floor after suffering 20+ stab wounds, her death was ruled a suicide. <br>

      <title>Episode 265: Tragedy &amp; True Crime at the Jean Harlow House</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Some say the Jean Harlow house where she lived with her husband Paul Bern is one of the most haunted homes in America.

      <title>Episode 264: The New England Vampire Panic</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
<br>
Today Alaina decided to take it to a vampiric place. During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries New England was struggling with severe outbreaks of Consumption.  To better explain this plague that caused severe pain, bloody hacking coughs and the victim to seemingly waste away without explanation, they turned to the supernatural. When entire families began falling victim to its brutal clutches, it simply had to be vampires who had taken host in their loved ones ailing bodies to suck the life from the remaining members. Come on in for a dive into a world where eating the ashes of an exhumed family member's decomposing heart was considered medicine.<br>

      <title>Episode 263: The Murder of Mackenzie Cowell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mackenzie Cowell was a beautiful 17 year old girl with her entire life ahead of her. She was going to high school, on the dance team, modelling and taking classes at the Wenatchee Academy of Hair design. Mackenzie’s life was cut short and in such a brutal manner that it left Wenatchee stunned. Mackenzie's body was found stabbed, strangled, and mutilated. The case takes so many twists and turns with drug informants, potential cases of mistaken identity and eventually a conviction that left some wondering if the right person was behind bars.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Alaina brings us another 2 part series this week, this time we’re talking about the Sunset Strip Killers, Doug Clark and Carol Bundy. It’s always wild to us how two shockingly depraved people can find each other like this, and this case brings wild to a new level. Together Doug and Carol would kill sex workers. Carol is only suspected in two murders; many are convinced she helped with more.<br>

      <title>Episode 260: The Eastern State Penitentiary</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ash promised you something haunted this week after Alaina’s three part deep dive into the Hillside Stranglers and boy did she pick a doozy. The Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia is supposedly one of America’s most haunted buildings. It has a fascinating, yet macabre history and it housed some of the world's most notorious criminals. We’ll get into all that history, talk about some of the most known prisoners and then dive into the most haunted cell blocks that remain standing today!<br>

      <title>Episode 258: The Hillside Stranglers Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We’ve made it to part two of three of Alaina’s deep dive into the depraved minds of Angelo Buono and Kenny Biaanchi. If you’ve made it to this part, you know that this cousin duo is out on the sunset strip terrorizing the lives of young women. You can only terrorize one area for so long though and in this part they decide to switch up not only their way of getting victims, but also the process in which they torture and kill. This will be a tough one, and we hope to see you back for part three. <br>

      <title>Episode 257: The Tragic Story of Barbara Daly Baekeland</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ash brings us the story of Barbara Daly Baekeland, a New York socialite who ended up being murdered by her son Anthony “Tony” Baekeland. Barbara had a long history of mental illness and eventually her son did as well, some argue Tony’s mental illness began when his mother tried to “cure him of his homosexuality” by taking him to bed herself. This was definitely a hard one to get through, but is a fascinating case for sure.<br>

In part one we’ll go over some background on each of them, how they linked up and their first 2 murders. <br>

      <title>Preview Dr. Death Season 3: Miracle Man</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Paolo is a smart and handsome surgeon, renowned for his ability to perform surgeries that transform his patients’ lives. When television producer Benita covers him for a story, he’ll transform her life too, but not in the ways she expects. As Benita crosses professional lines to be with him, she learns how far Paolo will go to protect his secrets. And halfway around the world, four doctors at a prestigious medical institute make shocking discoveries of their own that call everything into question. From Wondery comes Season Three of the hit podcast, Dr. Death. MIRACLE MAN tells the story of a globe-trotting surgeon who seduces the medical world, and sweeps one woman off her feet.

      <title>Episode 255: True Crime Songs with Ronnie &amp; Ben from Watch What Crappens!</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This episode we are joined by Ronnie Karam and Ben Mandelker of the Watch What Crappens podcast, for something a bit different! Throughout the years recording Morbid we’ve come across an abundance of songs that were inspired by true crime events. We figured it would be pretty interesting to break down some of the crimes and songs with these fellas. We revisit the Moors murders to talk about The Smith’s ballad “Suffer Little Children,” reminisce on hearing Fastball’s “The Way” while having no idea that it was inspired by something dark and last but not least we dive into Neko Case’s “Deep Red Bells,” which was inspired by the Green River Killer’s victims. <br>

        <![CDATA[Y’all, if you haven’t heard of the Erdington murders then you’re in for a doozy. Ash goes over the case of two young women, Mary Ashford and Barbara Forrest who were murdered 157 years apart in Erdington. The way that the two cases mirror each other is just so bonkers and will have you questioning if some kind of Fear Street witch cursed the area. Oh also there’s a trial by combat, so there’s that.<br>

      <title>Episode 253: Buried Alive</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA["If the beard wags, please no body bags."<br>
<br>


<br>
Today, Alaina is going to take you on a journey that you never wanted to take. Today, we go into the fear, history and hysteria around the idea of premature burial. In this episode, you will learn about screaming and chewing corpses, methods of making sure the dead is really dead, patented safety coffins and examples of real people who were buried alive. Maybe listen to this one in a big open field? Or the open ocean? I don't know. It may help. <br>

      <title>Episode 252: Charles Schmid "The Pied Piper of Tucson"</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[For our second episode this week, Ash brings us the case of Charles Schmid aka the Pied Piper of Tucson. This case, dare we say, may be one of the wildest rides we’ve brought you along for in quite some time. Charles was really a vibe in the 60’s, at least according to the youths of the day. He would change his appearance quite drastically when he turned 18 and it was at that moment he became a hot commodity. However, he was one of the most evil, callous assholes on the planet. He was responsible for the deaths of three young girls, one being his girlfriend at the time, and some say there’s a fourth victim. Buckle up, buttercups. <br>

      <title>Episode 251: Tara Calico</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The Tara Calico case is one that will have your mind going for days. This is a very prominent case in the true crime world, and for good reason: it’s still unsolved after 33 years. Tara Calico was 19 when she went missing after heading out on a routine bike ride. For years no one was entirely sure what to make of the case, especially when a polaroid showed up and the woman in the photo bore a striking resemblance to Tara. However, as this case unfolds, small town secrets start to surface and many are convinced the answer has been around for years but covered up by the very people claiming to want justice. <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Bettie Page became known for her direct gaze into the camera and iconic pin-up girl bangs as a model, but there are so many things that people don’t know about her. And boy, is her life a whirlwind. Bettie went through a lot in her early years as a child, more when she started modelling and her later life was filled with such violence and trauma. We thought we knew the whole story, but wow these layers.<br>

      <itunes:summary>Bettie Page became known for her direct gaze into the camera and iconic pin-up girl bangs as a model, but there are so many things that people don’t know about her. And boy, is her life a whirlwind. Bettie went through a lot in her early years as a child, more when she started modelling and her later life was filled with such violence and trauma. We thought we knew the whole story, but wow these layers.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 249: The Horrific Murders of Austin Wenner &amp; Jessica Lewis</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[On June 19 2020, a group of tik tokers stumbled across a suitcase on a Seattle beach. They used the app Randonautica to get to the exact location and thought maybe there would be money in the suitcase. Instead they realized something much more sinister and called police. Inside, the suitcase were the remains of Jessica Lewis and Austin Wenner, a couple who’d been together for nearly 8 years. <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Melanie Nadia Ethier grew up in Northern Ontario in a pretty small community. At the time, the community was made up of only about 4,400 people. Melanie was 15 years old when she went missing after watching movies at a friends house. That would be the last night anyone saw her alive again, and it’s been over 24 years. Anyone with information regarding the disappearance of Melanie Ethier is asked to contact the director of the Criminal Investigation Branch of the OPP at 1-888-310-1122 or 705-329-6111 or their nearest police authority.<br>

Anyone with information regarding the disappearance of Melanie Ethier is asked to contact the director of the Criminal Investigation Branch of the OPP at 1-888-310-1122 or 705-329-6111 or their nearest police authority.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 242: John Edward Robinson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[John Edward Robinson is one of the wildest schemers you’ll probably hear about. He spent most of his early life creating fake businesses and scheming investors and co-workers out of thousands of dollars. Somehow he avoided long prison terms and was able to fly under the radar of his parole officers in a big way. Things started to escalate even more though when John started “helping” young mothers out. You’re going to want to hear the end of this one guys, and we’ll see you soon for part 2!<br>

        <![CDATA[John Edward Robinson is one of the wildest schemers you’ll probably hear about. He spent most of his early life creating fake businesses and scheming investors and co-workers out of thousands of dollars. Somehow he avoided long prison terms and was able to fly under the radar of his parole officers in a big way. Things started to escalate even more though when John started “helping” young mothers out. You’re going to want to hear the end of this one guys, and we’ll see you soon for part 2!<br>

        <![CDATA[Stephen Griffiths dubbed himself the Crossbow Killer after murdering and dismembering three women.

Stephen Griffith’s took all three of their lives away in a horrific, coldblooded manner because he simply wanted to be a serial killer. <br>

      <title>Episode 240: The Lady of the Dunes</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We’re bringing you to one of our favorite vacation spots: Provincetown Mass. Only we aren’t sunbathing and playing volleyball on the beach, we’re here to solve a cold case, y’all. The Lady of the Dunes, as she’s known, was discovered  on July 26, 1974, in the tall grass at the Race Point Dunes. Throughout the past 47 years investigators have worked tirelessly following up on leads and exhuming her body every time some kind of new technology comes up. To this day they still don’t know who killed the woman, or more importantly, who the woman even is!<br>

      <title>Episode 238: The Phillip Island Murder</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The night of September 22, 1986 was an absolute nightmare on Phillip Island. On an island known for its nightly penguin parades, no one expected to find a young woman brutally murdered on her bedroom floor. Elizabeth “Beth” Barnard was only 23 years old when she was discovered stabbed to death and left with the letter “A” carved into her abdomen. She’d been having an affair with a married man, Fergus Cameron. Did his wife Vivienne do this to Beth, or was it a stalker from her past?<br>

        <![CDATA[Lake Lanier.. Honestly I feel like that’s all I need to say. This place has so much creepy surrounding it!! There are giant catfish that have been compared to volkswagen, phantom hands pulling you under the water and not to mention the entire submerged counties that lie beneath. There are also multiple deaths and murders that have occured in or around the lake. So much to unpack here, just in time for your memorial day weekend!!<br>

      <title>Episode 235: The Unbelievable Tale of Michael Malloy AKA Mike The Durable</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[
<br>
You guys. You’re in for a real treat if you’ve never heard the tale of Michael Malloy. To call him durable is to vastly undersell this story. This dude not only survived about 67 attempts on his life, but did it while- let’s just say more than heavily intoxicated! He is a true iron man. <br>

      <title>Episode 234: The Smiley Face Deaths/Murder Mystery</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Since 1997 young men have been disappearing for periods of time and then turning up in bodies of water. Upon first glance it’s easy to brush these off as accidents, young men drinking too much and slipping or falling to their deaths: sad but not unheard of. It was in 2008 that Kevin Gannon, Anthony Duarte, Mike Donovan and Dr. Lee Gilbertson presented a theory to the world: What if these cases aren’t accidents at all? What if there is some kind of gang spread across the nation, picking these guys off 1 by 1. Insert the name of the case, The Smiley Face Killers.  <br>

But the events on the final night of her life leave some with questions about Robert Wagner… did he push his beloved wife overboard?<br>

        <![CDATA[Natalie Wood had one of the most troubling back stories a child star could have, a stage mom that crossed all imaginable boundaries, a violent alcoholic for a father and men that took advantage of her all throughout her life. She thought she had found safety in Robert Wagner, who she was married to twice. But the events on the final night of her life leave some with questions about Robert Wagner… did he push his beloved wife overboard?<br>

In this episode we will go over the murders of Cheryl Dunlap, Meredith Emerson and John and Irene Bryant.<br>

Together we wonder what a car is exactly, why the Hollywood machine is so scary and whether we are prepared to be found paradoxically undressed. Thanks so much to Cameron for joining us! <br>

        <![CDATA[Tyler Hadley was 17 years old when he decided to bludgeon his parents and then throw the rager of a lifetime (in his eyes.) Close to a hundred people attended this party not knowing that in a separate locked bedroom down the hall, the bodies of Mary Jo and Blake Hadley were laying under a hodgepodge of household items. We redid this case to offer some new information and woah, somehow it’s even more disturbing the second time around.  BUT to lighten some of the darkest moments, we have added in clips from the original episode because we could never replace the original "FA SHO!!" ;)<br>

      <title>Episode 225: The Abduction and Murder of Daniel Morcombe</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Daniel Morcombe was 13 years old when he was taken from a bus stop in Queensland Australia. Queensland was supposed to be one of the safest places to live so this absolutely rocked the community. It would be 8 years before anyone would get answers, and the man who gave the answers is one of the scariest people to walk the planet. <br>

      <title>Episode 221: The Los Feliz Murder House</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's a DO-OVER!<br>
<br>


<br>
This tale has always been such a crazy one that we just had to do it again and do it right. <br>
<br>


<br>
On December 6, 1959, respected and renowned doctor, Harold Perelson, turned his family's dream home into a nightmare when he snapped in the dead of night and left a trail of blood in his wake. This house would come to be known as the Los Feliz Murder House for a good reason.<br>

        <![CDATA[It's a DO-OVER!<br>
<br>


<br>
This tale has always been such a crazy one that we just had to do it again and do it right. <br>
<br>


<br>
On December 6, 1959, respected and renowned doctor, Harold Perelson, turned his family's dream home into a nightmare when he snapped in the dead of night and left a trail of blood in his wake. This house would come to be known as the Los Feliz Murder House for a good reason.<br>

      <title>Episode 220: The Tragic Murder of Kenia Monge/ The Incredible Survival Tale of Lydia Tillman</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Kenia Monge was 19 years old when she went missing after a night out with her friends in Colorado. While her father Tony was trying to call her friends and find out what had happened that night, a text came through to Kenia’s phone from a number she didn’t have saved. It was from a man named Travis who claimed to have attempted to give her a ride home the previous night. Tony agreed to go meet the man and talk, but when he shook Travis’s hand, he knew he was shaking the hand of the man who killed his daughter. The rest of the events throughout the case are shocking and will have you holding on to your butt til’ the very end. <br>

      <title>Episode 218: Who Put Bella In The Wych Elm?</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Who put Bella in the Wych Elm? This is an episode we covered in our earlier days brought to you by Alaina, but she kept up with it and ended up finding so much more information that she wanted to redo it for ya! Here’s our second take on the episode with some new insight, maybe we’ll finally close this chapter.<br>
<br>
Here are the books mentioned in the episode! Very recommended reads for this case!<br>
<br>
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Who-Put-Bella-Wych-Elm/dp/1984288814/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1KKTD4ESI2FST&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=who+put+bella+in+the+wych+elm&amp;qid=1616108312&amp;sprefix=who+put+bell%2Caps%2C156&amp;sr=8-4" target="_blank">Who Put Bella In The Wych Elm Volume 1</a><br>

</a><br>
Another really great podcast that did a goosebumps inducing narration of this case is The Unexplained Podcast. Here are the two parts of his show on the subject, just for some extra spooky listening!<br>

      <itunes:summary>Who put Bella in the Wych Elm? This is an episode we covered in our earlier days brought to you by Alaina, but she kept up with it and ended up finding so much more information that she wanted to redo it for ya! Here’s our second take on the episode with some new insight, maybe we’ll finally close this chapter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Here are the books mentioned in the episode! Very recommended reads for this case!&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 215: The Torture and Murder of Shanda Sharer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Shanda Sharer was 12 years old when she met a girl named Amanda. Amanda was already involved in a troubling relationship with a girl named Melinda Loveless and when Amanda and Shanda started hanging out Melinda became even more possessive of Amanda and started threatening Shanda. Melinda would tell anyone who would listen that she was going to kill Shanda someday, but for some reason no one took her seriously. One night Melinda gathered a group of friends including: Lauri Tacket, Hope Rippey and Toni Lawrence. The mission was to trick Shanda into thinking Amanda wanted to see her, but Amanda was not there. Three of the four girls then brutally tortured and murdered 12 year old Shanda Sharer, while one did nothing to stop them. This story is incredibly difficult to get through, but just like all of our cases, deserves to be told so that the memory of Shanda never fades. <br>
<br>
Books used for researching the case:<br>
Cruel Sacrifice by Aphrodite Jones<br>
Little Lost Angel by Michael Quinlan <br>

      <title>Episode 214: The Tragic Case of Molly Bish</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Molly Bish was 16 years old and working as a lifeguard at Comins Pond in Warren. She’d only been working there about a week on June 27th, 2000 when her mother dropped her off for her 10:00 shift. Swimmers would be arriving any minute, but just minutes later when they started piling in for swim lessons, there was no lifeguard on duty. In a matter of minutes Molly vanished, but it would be three years before her partial remains would be discovered, and over twenty with no answers. This case remains unsolved to this day, although the investigation is very much active. **Anyone With information about the Molly Bish case should call the State Police tip line at 508-453-7575<br>

Colleen was twenty years old on May 19 1977 when she accepted a ride from Cameron and Janice Hooker. They looked to be about her age, and the woman was holding a baby, what could go wrong? The next seven years of Colleen’s life would be an absolute nightmare. She didn’t realize the man driving the car she got into was a sexual sadist and had plans to make her his sex slave. <br>

      <title>Episode 211: Willie "Piggy" Pickton Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Part two of Willie is somehow more bonkers than part one. More and more people are coming forward with their experiences at ~the farm~ but no one is taking this case as seriously as they should. Huge numbers of women are going missing, but are seen as less dead or are put to the bottom of the list because of their “high risk lifestyles.” But somewhere in the middle of our story the investigation gets revamped and Scott Chubb really does his best to save the day, are you ready for the end of this?!<br>

        <![CDATA[I don't even know what to write about this WILD CASE. We’re finally diving into Willie Pictkotn, it’s filthy, it’s dirty, it’s squalor, it’s vile and it’s only the beginning. This is part one of Willie Pickton, we’ll get into the story of his childhood, take a glimpse into his family’s life and then we’ll find ourselves somehow deeper in this foul hole when we reach his adulthood. This is only the tip of the iceberg, and we are horrified. <br>

        <![CDATA[I don't even know what to write about this WILD CASE. We’re finally diving into Willie Pictkotn, it’s filthy, it’s dirty, it’s squalor, it’s vile and it’s only the beginning. This is part one of Willie Pickton, we’ll get into the story of his childhood, take a glimpse into his family’s life and then we’ll find ourselves somehow deeper in this foul hole when we reach his adulthood. This is only the tip of the iceberg, and we are horrified. <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hey weirdos! We want to allow you to get to know our little family here on Morbid Network, so we decided to start a special interview series where we chat with the hosts of these handpicked shows and let you get to know why we love their guts! With these special episodes, you also get a sneak preview of their latest episode to really wet your whistle to dive into a new pod. Yes, that was a disgusting sentence but that's who we are.<br>
<br>
Today, we chat with beautiful, hilarious and spicy Tyler Hyde and Johnny Cann from That's Spooky. If Tyler and Johnny's personalities don't immediately make you fall for them, their ability to tell a story with compassion, spice and lighthearted humor in all the right places  will have you swooning in seconds. We chatted with these about their relationship, their favorite paranormal happenings and how That's Spooky came to be. Come on it, friends. The water is fabulous. <br>

      <title>Episode 209: The Slenderman Stabbing</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Slenderman, you know him. He’s the creepy tall dude lurking in the woods without a face. He was created in 2009 on Something Awful by a man named Eric Knudesen and has dominated the internet ever since. In 2014 two Wisconsin girls pledged their allegiance to Slenderman by stabbing their best friend 19 times and leaving her for dead in the middle of the woods. They thought they would be off to live in his mansion in the forest, but that wasn’t exactly the end of it all.<br>

        <![CDATA[Slenderman, you know him. He’s the creepy tall dude lurking in the woods without a face. He was created in 2009 on Something Awful by a man named Eric Knudesen and has dominated the internet ever since. In 2014 two Wisconsin girls pledged their allegiance to Slenderman by stabbing their best friend 19 times and leaving her for dead in the middle of the woods. They thought they would be off to live in his mansion in the forest, but that wasn’t exactly the end of it all.<br>

      <title>Episode 208: The Horrific Murder of Ashley Young</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you knew Ashely Young she was probably the kindest, most genuine human being you’ve ever met. Her favorite thing to ask people was, “if I bought you a smile would you wear it?” Jared Chance didn’t deserve to know Ashley, and didn’t deserve her friendship, but that’s who Ashley was, someone who thought everyone had at least a little good in them. Unfortunately, she was wrong about Jared, who didn’t have even a fiber of goodness throughout him, and he was the one who took Ashley’s life in 2018. No one knows exactly what happened because Jared had help from his dad, a former police officer, and his mother to cover up the murder.<br>

Emilie stayed in contact with her abuser throughout life, as she struggled to heal from what he had done to her. This had all started in the mid to late 90’s and finally in 2013 Emilie was ready to come forward and put a stop to the abuse this man was allegedly continuing to inflict on the young women around him. Unfortunately before the case could move forward, Emilie was found dead in her apartment, under some pretty mysterious circumstances.<br>

      <title>Episode 204: **AD FREE** The Mysterious Disappearance of Brittanee Drexel Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's here! This is the conclusion to our discussion about the mysterious and truly tragic disappearance of 17 year old Brittanee Drexel from Myrtle Beach, SC in 2009. In this part we discuss the Taylor family's possible/alleged involvement, theories of human trafficking and also read some listener emails from people who personally know Jennifer Oberer, Alanna Lippa and John Grieco. This case needs to be solved, guys. The FBI is still offering a $25,000 reward for any information leading to this case being solved. <br>
<br>
To the Drexel Family, we hope you get the justice that you and Brittanee deserve.

      <title>Episode 203: The Mysterious Disappearance of Brittanee Drexel</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Brittanee Drexel was 17 years old when two girls, Alanna Lippa and Jennifer Oberer, invited her to go on spring break with them. The girls were from Chili New York and were planning to head to Myrtle beach for a long weekend. Brittanee’s mom, Dawn Drexel, told her she couldn’t go because she didn’t know the girls Brittanee would be going with and was afraid something bad would happen. Britanee told her mom she was just staying with friends for the weekend instead, but really she went out to Myrtle Beach, and disappeared within 2 days. There are many horrible theories as to what happened to Brittanee that will break your heart. But it’s an important story to tell, in the hopes justice will someday be served.

      <title>Episode 202: The Tragic Story of Cinnamon Brown</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Cinnamon Brown was 14 years old when her own father, David Brown, convinced her to carry out the murder of her stepmother, Linda Bailey Brown. Cinnamon was fully convinced and brainwashed into thinking that she wouldn’t do jail time and instead just have to see a psychiatrist. Little did she know, she’d be taken away in cuffs and sent to a California Youth Authority facility for the next 4 years while her father and his new wife cashed in on Linda’s life insurance policy and lived the good life. Don't worry though, Cinnamon came back strong and David got what he deserved.

      <title>Episode 201: Black Eyed Children with special guest Tyler Gaca AKA Ghosthoney</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Guys!!! It's episode two hundred… and ONE! We’ve gathered you here today so we could grace your presence with one of the most lovely humans we’ve ever encountered: Ghost Honey aka Tyler Gaca. Tyler joins us today to talk about something we vowed to never attempt an episode on: Black Eyed Children. The first time we tried to do this episode some weird shit went down and it just straight up wouldn’t record. Luckily, we got our shit together and think the united force of the three of us kept the spooky unexplainable. Alaina takes us into the origin story, and Ash tells some spooky stories you can find on Thought Catalog. Hold onto your butts… and your noses i guess. It’s about to get real weird up in here.

      <title>Episode 200: The Weepy Voiced Killer</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week Alaina covers the weepy voiced killer for our 209th episode! In 1980 on New Year’s Eve Paul Michael Stephani brutally attacked Karen Potack after abducting her from outside of a bar. She sustained some of the worst injuries seen by investigators,  but she lived. This would be the first in a string of bizarre an gruesome attacks on women that potentially would lead to murder. The strangest piece of this case is that the killer called the police himself to report the attack....an he did it while weeping hysterically. <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s Ash-centric! Let’s kick off the week by telling the story of Susan Wright, AKA the Blue Eyed Butcher. Susan’s crime is absolutely wild, she stabbed her husband 193 times and then claimed self defense. She got two trials, and her third shot at parole worked: Susan Smith was released from prison on the morning of December 30th. Let's hope she adopted the, “New year New me motto.”

      <title>Episode 198: The Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The conclusion to this horrific case is finally here. Tonight we talk about Oklahoma's most massive manhunt, we discuss the mounting evidence against Gene Leroy Hart and we discuss some questionable police work that may have cost them their case in the end. Unfortunately, this case technically remains unsolved, despite many attempts to get something from the DNA evidence that was poorly stored for so many years. It's a tragedy that hopefully will one day have some real closure.

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>198</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>The conclusion to this horrific case is finally here. Tonight we talk about Oklahoma's most massive manhunt, we discuss the mounting evidence against Gene Leroy Hart and we discuss some questionable police work that may have cost them their case in the end. Unfortunately, this case technically remains unsolved, despite many attempts to get something from the DNA evidence that was poorly stored for so many years. It's a tragedy that hopefully will one day have some real closure.

      <title>Episode 197: Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Alaina pulls at our heartstrings this week with part one of the Oklahoma Girl Scout Murders. In June of 1977, eight year old Lori Lee Farmer, nine year old Michelle Heather Guse and ten year old Doris Denise Milner headed off to Camp Scott for a two week girl scout experience. Unfortunately someone, or potentially multiple someones, had been lurking around the camp in the weeks leading up to night one. Whoever it was had more than sinister plans to kill the three girl scouts camping out in tent one. In Part One we’ll go over who each girl was, the night of the murders and we’ll end it on a pretty convincing suspect. Don’t bet too heavy on him though, in part two Alaina will bring some evidence to the table pointing away from who we thought was our lead suspect.

      <title>Episode 196: The Senseless Murder of Lauren Giddings</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Your Ash-centric episode this week is about the murder of Lauren Giddings. Lauren was 27 years old and had just graduated law school when she was brutally murdered and dismembered by her neighbor, Stephen McDaniel. Stephen McDaniel had been stalking Lauren for quite some time, breaking into her house, moving things around and plotting her murder. There were a few suspects in the beginning but police were able to narrow it down to Stephen after his strange behaviour when he heard a body had been discovered. We’ll leave the rest of the details to the episode!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hey weirdos! We figured we would grace your ear meat this week with a mashup of spooky roads and listener tales! Alaina tells us about two spooky roads located in Illinois: Bloody Gulch Road and The Devil's Backbone. Then we dive into a couple of Illinois themed listener tales. We’ve got a lady in red, who doesn’t love a game of tag and a camper who makes Wednesday Addams seem like a more desirable bunkmate, I mean wasn’t she anyway?

      <title>Episode 194: Tony Costa, The Cape Cod Vampire Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week Alaina’s got a two parter, pretty close to home for us! Tony Costa, a hippie living around Provincetown in the 60’s, was a real shady character from the start. When he was a teenager he straight up broke into the home of a girl two years younger than him, proceeded to drag her down the stairs, and later told police he, “just wanted to talk to her!” Ok, Tony. It only gets weirder from there. Patricia Walsh and Mary Ann Wysocki head to the cape for a relaxing weekend getaway and meet Tony during their stay. Interestingly enough, they never return home and Tony is the last person to see them.
<br>

Alaina recommends the book, In His Garden by Leo Damore

      <title>Episode 193: The Horrific Kidnapping &amp; Murder of Sarah Haley Foxwell</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It was Christmastime 2009 and eleven year old Sarah Haley Foxwell was getting ready to celebrate with her family. She and her little sister skipped off to bed together, but that would be the last time Sarah’s family got to see her. Sarah was kidnapped, assaulted and brutally murdered by a man <em>she knew</em>. Thomas Leggs was a convicted sexual offender, who had slipped through the cracks in the system time and time again, he should have been incarcerated at the time Sarah was taken, but somehow posted bond. Sarah’s death was not in vain though, Sarah’s law was passed and cracked down on these kinds of criminals.

<strong>If a you or a child you know has been the victim of sexual assault, here are some resources:</strong>

      <itunes:title>The Horrific Kidnapping &amp; Murder of Sarah Haley Foxwell</itunes:title>

      <itunes:episode>193</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>It was Christmastime 2009 and eleven year old Sarah Haley Foxwell was getting ready to celebrate with her family. She and her little sister skipped off to bed together, but that would be the last time Sarah’s family got to see her. Sarah was kidnapped, assaulted and brutally murdered by a man &lt;em&gt;she knew&lt;/em&gt;. Thomas Leggs was a convicted sexual offender, who had slipped through the cracks in the system time and time again, he should have been incarcerated at the time Sarah was taken, but somehow posted bond. Sarah’s death was not in vain though, Sarah’s law was passed and cracked down on these kinds of criminals. 
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;If a you or a child you know has been the victim of sexual assault, here are some resources:&lt;/strong&gt;

      <title>Episode 192: The Tragic Murder of Sarah Ludemann</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week Alaina covers a tale as old as time but with a modern MySpace twist. Two girls fighting over one dingus of a boy. Rachel Wade was living her best Bad Girls Club life, dating the quintessential bad boy, Josh Camacho. Josh Camacho was dating many other girls that Rachel didn’t know about though, specifically Sarah Ludemann. Instead of blaming Josh for being a two timer when they both found out about each other, the girls took out their anger on each other by fighting on myspace, through text messages and eventually voicemails. The tension between them kept getting higher and higher, and would eventually end in an explosive fight that would take one of their lives, far too soon.

      <title>Episode 191: The Horrific Murder of Dorothy Stratten</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Ash wanted to dive into a vintage Hollywood case this week, and the Dorothy Stratten case stuck out like a sore thumb! Dorothy Stratten was 17 years old working behind the counter at a Dairy Queen in Canada when Paul Snider took notice of her. He was struck by her beauty, and saw her as more of a meal ticket to climb his way up the social ladder in Hollywood. Dorothy became a huge playboy star, becoming Miss August 1979 and later Playmate of the year for 1980, but her steady incline in the world of modeling and acting all came plummeting down in August 1980 when Paul Snider decided if he couldn’t have Dorothy, neither could anyone else.

      <title>Episode 190: Martha Haney</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's another old timey murder from Alaina! But trust us, this one will have your jaw hitting the floor. Way back in 1897 Michigan, Martha Haney's struggle with her own illness reached the point of no return when she lashed out against an easy target, her 85 year old mother in law Mariah Haney. Let's just say that this one is rough. Good luck and good night, friends.<br>
<br>
Alaina found this crazy tale while stumbling upon the writings of Rod Sadler, a retired police officer and true crime writer who has a very personal connection to this particular case. His writing is great. Here are links to all of his books including To Hell I Must Go, which is the book that sucked Alaina down the rabbit hole of this case.<br>

      <itunes:summary>It's another old timey murder from Alaina! But trust us, this one will have your jaw hitting the floor. Way back in 1897 Michigan, Martha Haney's struggle with her own illness reached the point of no return when she lashed out against an easy target, her 85 year old mother in law Mariah Haney. Let's just say that this one is rough. Good luck and good night, friends.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Alaina found this crazy tale while stumbling upon the writings of Rod Sadler, a retired police officer and true crime writer who has a very personal connection to this particular case. His writing is great. Here are links to all of his books including To Hell I Must Go, which is the book that sucked Alaina down the rabbit hole of this case.&lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 188: Angela Diaz</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[For the Ash-centric episode this week, we’ve got a doozy. Angela Diaz and Michelle Hadley were two women who had no idea of each other’s mere existence until they met a man named Ian Diaz. Ian had been engaged to Michelle and things got messy quickly. When he moved on to Angela, everything seemed perfect, for a little while at least. Then the expecting young newlywed couple were rocked by a series of threatening emails and sinister craigslist solicitors, but who could be behind it?

      <title>Episode 187: The Farmville Murders</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[We’re stepping into an unknown world for us this week: the world of horrorcore. In 2009 twenty year old Richard Sam Mccroskey travelled across the country to go to a horrorcore music festival with two girls he had become friends with via Myspace, sixteen year old Emma Niederbrock and eighteen year old Melanie Wells. Richard, Emma and Emma’s best friend Melanie would all be staying at Emma's house after the concert. Richard, aka Syko Sam, had it in his mind that Emma was his girlfriend, but after meeting her he realized his feelings were not reciprocated. Instead of moving on, he made the decision to brutally murder everyone staying in the home, including Emma. <br>

      <title>Episode 186: The Mysterious Unsolved Death of Elisa Lam</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In February 2013 the guests at The Cecil hotel started making multiple complaints to the front desk about the water in their room. Some said the tap water had a funny taste to it, others said the water pressure was basically non-existent. A maintenance worker was sent to check on the status of one of the main water tanks and made the horrifying discovery of a young woman who had been missing for three weeks: Elisa Lam. There are about four hundred thousand theories as to how Elisa ended up in the water tank so let’s dive in.

      <title>Episode 182: The Dybbuk Box</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week we’re talking about one of the most haunted objects in the world. The Dybbuk box stepped on the ebay scene in September 2001 and nothing has ever been the same. The word, “Dybbuk” comes from Jewish folklore and literally means, “to cling.” An otherworldly spirit was captured in the box during the holocaust and when Kevin Mannis bought it at an estate sale, brought it home and opened it, his life changed forever. So did the lives of the next two owners, and anyone who has seen the movie The Possession, based on the box! Keep it weird, but not so weird that you open a cursed box and ruin your life!<br>

      <title>Episode 180: The Bizarre Murder of Marlene Warren</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Sometimes justice is a plate best served cold. 20 years ago a clown knocked on Marlene Warren’s door holding balloons, flowers and something else incredibly sinister. While the clown walked calmly away to their white Chrysler Le Baron, Marlene was left lying in a pool of blood. They looked at the husband straight away, his alibi was air tight…. Or was it? Maybe his mistress Sheila Keen could offer up some information?<br>

      <title>Episode 175: The Brutal Murder of Elyse Pahler</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you’ve ever watched the movie Jennifer’s Body, you’ve probably heard that it was inspired by a true crime case, and promptly rolled your eyes at whoever told you so. Well the truth is, it actually was. In July of 1995 Elyse Pahler snuck out of her house to meet with three boys she was beginning to consider friends. They lured her to a Eucalyptus field where they strangled, stabbed and raped her dead body all in the name of Satan. They made claims that they thought sacrificing a virgin to the devil himself would make their guitar playing better and take them to new levels of potential fame. Spoiler alert: it didn’t.

      <title>Episode 173: The Twisted Deeds &amp; Many Names of Peter Tobin</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week Alaina is diving into the Peter Tobin case! Peter Tobin, who was also known as Patrick McLaughlin, James Kelley and many other names, may have killed as many as 48. He was sentenced to life in prison and when he told investigators how many he’d killed he followed it up with “figure it out” and grinned. Lots to unpack here, and it will lead us into our next episode about Bible John, who may have actually been Peter Tobin. <br>

      <title>Episode 172: The Papin Sisters</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In 1933 The Papin sisters brutally murdered two members of the family that they worked for, for seven years. After Christine and Lea’s troubled childhood, they went to work for the Lancelin family and grew very close with each other, we all know how that “us against the world” thing goes. One February evening, things went very wrong, and would eventually lead to a debate of Folie a deux vs pure evil.

      <title>Episode 171: Lake Shawnee Amusement Park</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week we are getting spooky with it. You might be an amusement park junkie, but we’re warning you, hold on to your butts if you’re headed to the Lake Shawnee Amusement park. Alaina gives us the intense history surrounding the land before it became a park, the horrible events that happened while it was a functioning park and the aftermath of the defunct park today. We’re serious, you’re going to want to be holding on tight to that butt!

      <description>
        <![CDATA[This week's mini morbid is Ash-centric and way harsh, Ty. We’re looking into the death of actress, Brittany Murphy. Did she simply die of natural causes or did the husband do it? Brittany collapsed in her home on Dec 20, 2009 and the details surrounding the case have always struck us as strange, secretive and quite frankly, dark. Something leaves us with a bad taste in our mouths here.

      <itunes:summary>Oh man guys. Part 3 of the Moors Murderers is going to take years off your life or at least rob a small part of your soul. This week we cover the last two murders of Lesley Ann Downey and Edward Evans. Luckily this week we get the satisfaction of hearing how these two horrific beasts, Myra and Ian were brought to justice. Hold tight to those butts!

      <title>Episode 167: Ian Brady &amp; Myra Hindley AKA The Moors Murderers Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Tonight is a tough one, guys and ghouls. Tonight we continue our Moors Murders series as we cover the brutal assaults and murders of 16 year old Pauline Reade, 12 year old John Kilbride and 12 year old Keith Bennett by true demons Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. These abductions and murders will sound like something out a horror movie but unfortunately, they are all too real for the victims' families. Brady and Hindley left a trail of chaos and shattered hearts in their paths. Listener discretion is advised.<br>

      <title>Episode 166: Ian Brady &amp; Myra Hindley AKA The Moors Murderers Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's here. Alaina has been both anticipating and dreading this day since Morbid's conception. We all have those cases that have haunted us since we first read them, and this is one of those rare nightmares that will stay with you long after you hear it. <br>
Today Alaina covers Part 1 of The Moors Murders. Tonight, we talk about Ian Brady and Myra Hindley's lives before they met each other, we look into their fateful meeting and their toxic relationship and we hate on them, hard. Part 2 and Part 3 will follow in succession. This case is a doozy.<br>

        <![CDATA[It's here. Alaina has been both anticipating and dreading this day since Morbid's conception. We all have those cases that have haunted us since we first read them, and this is one of those rare nightmares that will stay with you long after you hear it. <br>
Today Alaina covers Part 1 of The Moors Murders. Tonight, we talk about Ian Brady and Myra Hindley's lives before they met each other, we look into their fateful meeting and their toxic relationship and we hate on them, hard. Part 2 and Part 3 will follow in succession. This case is a doozy.<br>

      <title>Episode 162: The Gruesome Murder of Brenda Sue Schaefer Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[The first of two parts in the Brenda Sue Schaefer murder case. Brenda was a modest, hard working woman just looking for the right man to fall in love and enjoy life with. Unfortunately she met Mel Ignato instead. This installment we’re getting Ashcentric with it and talking about who Brenda was, what her first relationships were like and what the events were leading up to her disappearance. Of course we gotta leave you on a cliffhanger, but feel free to head to a chilli restaurant while you wait for part two! See you next week.

      <itunes:title>The Gruesome Murder of Brenda Sue Schaefer Part 1</itunes:title>
      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>162</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>The first of two parts in the Brenda Sue Schaefer murder case. Brenda was a modest, hard working woman just looking for the right man to fall in love and enjoy life with. Unfortunately she met Mel Ignato instead. This installment we’re getting Ashcentric with it and talking about who Brenda was, what her first relationships were like and what the events were leading up to her disappearance. Of course we gotta leave you on a cliffhanger, but feel free to head to a chilli restaurant while you wait for part two! See you next week.

      <title>Episode 161: The Scream Murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[For the MEGA-Morbid this week Alaina dives into the real life, “Scream” murder of Cassie Jo Stoddart. Cassie was murdered by two friends and classmates, Torey Adamcik and Brian Draper, while she was house sitting in a big house in the middle of nowhere: everyone’s worst fear. These two jerks terrorized Cassie in her final hours all because they wanted to make a movie and know what it felt like to kill someone. Alaina roasts these Billy and Stu wanna-bes almost as hard as BTK as we cover what happened prior to, during and after the murder. <br>

      <title>Episode 157: The Senseless Murder of Vanessa Guillen</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Specialist Vanessa Guillen went missing from Fort Hood Military Base on April 22, 2020. She was last seen at the armory and the last person she was seen working alongside was fellow soldier and specialist Aaron Robinson. Weeks before her disappearance, she told those closest to her that she had been dealing with a fellow soldier, a sergeant, that was sexually harassing her and she was ready to report it. <br>
<br>
June 30, her dismembered, burned and mutilated remains were found crudely buried in quick cement/earth alongside the Leon River in Belton Texas. Robinson took his own life in an attempt to escape his crime but his girlfriend Cecily Aguilar confessed to her part in the brutal mutilation and disposal of the body of a US soldier. Details of the crime and the following weeks are confusing and suspicious. Is there a coverup? Regardless of the truth, this brings to light the broader issue of reporting sexual assault in the military and Vanessa's family is trying to make sure those that defend our country are safe to report these issues without fear of repercussions.<br>

        <![CDATA[Specialist Vanessa Guillen went missing from Fort Hood Military Base on April 22, 2020. She was last seen at the armory and the last person she was seen working alongside was fellow soldier and specialist Aaron Robinson. Weeks before her disappearance, she told those closest to her that she had been dealing with a fellow soldier, a sergeant, that was sexually harassing her and she was ready to report it. <br>
<br>
June 30, her dismembered, burned and mutilated remains were found crudely buried in quick cement/earth alongside the Leon River in Belton Texas. Robinson took his own life in an attempt to escape his crime but his girlfriend Cecily Aguilar confessed to her part in the brutal mutilation and disposal of the body of a US soldier. Details of the crime and the following weeks are confusing and suspicious. Is there a coverup? Regardless of the truth, this brings to light the broader issue of reporting sexual assault in the military and Vanessa's family is trying to make sure those that defend our country are safe to report these issues without fear of repercussions.<br>

      <title>Episode 156: The Irish Vanishing Triangle Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Hi Ireland! You have some spooky stuff happening over there and we are ready to dive in. Today we take a look at the Irish Vanishing Triangle, where at least 6 (but definitely more) young women have vanished seemingly into thin air within an 80 mile radius near Dublin. Is there a serial killer at work picking off young, attractive women without leaving even a stray hair behind? In Part 1 we will talk about the disappearances of Annie McCarrick, Jojo Dollard and Fiona Pender. We touch upon theories and set up Part 2 for even more weird vibes. <br>
<br>
Former lead Investigator Alan Bailey's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1909718858?pf_rd_r=P08K1ZKDW98P1EFD3WPK&amp;pf_rd_p=edaba0ee-c2fe-4124-9f5d-b31d6b1bfbee" target="_blank">Missing, Presumed</a><br>
It's a great resource for all of the information you could ever want on this case as well as theories and insider knowledge from someone who worked the case for years. Great read!<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[The conclusion of our look into the Galveston 11 (part of the Texas Killing Fields) begs the question, did Edward Bell rape and murder these girls? Are there more out there? Bell seemed to be at the wrong places at the wrong times about 98% of his miserable life if he isn't the killer here, but Ash takes us further into his other known crimes and the last 5 murders that many attribute to his name. <br>

      <title>Episode 153: The Hex House Murder</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's a weird, 1920's murder involving magic, hexes and a straight up river witch. On Thanksgiving Eve in 1928, John Blymire had reached the end of his rope. He was down on his luck for the past year and he was convinced someone had hexed him. After multiple visits to witches and healers, he was told his fears were valid and that his neighbor was the one responsible for his bad luck. So he plotted to remove the hex placed on him, and he was willing to do <em>anything </em>to achieve peace.<br>

      <title>Episode 151: The Mysterious Death of Tamla Horsford</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Well, we have another mishandled case for you weirdos. The 2018 death of Tamla Horsford is tragic but it is also wildly suspicious. This 40 year old, mother of 5 was found face down in a back yard after attending an adult sleepover. Her injuries were varied and seemingly unexplainable for a fall from a second floor balcony. What makes this worse is the fact that this took place in Forsyth County, Georgia, a place with a documented history of racial prejudice. The case was quickly closed and called an accident despite several pieces of evidence pointing to something more sinister. Now, in 2020, Tamla's case has been officially reopened and what happened on that evening in November 2018 may finally come to light. <br>

This 40 year old, mother of 5 was found face down in a back yard after attending an adult sleepover. Her injuries were varied and seemingly unexplainable for a fall from a second floor balcony. What makes this worse is the fact that this took place in Forsyth County, Georgia, a place with a documented history of racial prejudice. The case was quickly closed and called an accident despite several pieces of evidence pointing to something more sinister. Now, in 2020, Tamla's case has been officially reopened and what happened on that evening in November 2018 may finally come to light. &lt;br&gt;

      <title>Episode 149: The Tragic Murder of Matthew Shepard Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[If you grew up in the 90s, Matthew Shepard's face is something that has probably stayed with you since his murder on October 6, 1998.<br>
<br>
Matthew was lured from a bar in Laramie, Wyoming by Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson. Their intent was to pose as gay men and rob Matthew. What occurred was much more than robbery. They used a .357 magnum revolver to beat him to death, tying him to a buck fence and leaving him to die for 18 hours in the freezing Wyoming cold. His death was a scream for stronger legislation of hate crimes, particularly against the LGBTQ+ community. In Part 1, we discuss Matt's life, his murderer's lives and his brutal assault. <br>

      <title>Episode 147: The Mysterious and Tragic Death of Kenneka Jenkins</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This case is baffling and seems like it deserves a second look. 19 year old Kenneka Jenkins was found dead of exposure, in a hotel freezer (with the door latched) after attending a hotel room party that same evening. There is a trail of strange Facebook Live videos and choppy surveillance film that provide more questions than answers. Is this a terrible and tragic accident or did something more sinister happen to Kenneka? <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[So for today's "mini", Alaina thought she was going to do Spooky Roads but then Scotland just went ahead and provided a whole-ass episode worth of spooky goodness that just had to be shared. Mary King's Close is a fascinating, terrifying and bizarre piece of Scottish history and add in the supreme darkness of Nor Loch, where murders run rampant, executions were carried out and accused witches were dunked to their deaths and you have a seriously spooky Scottish episode that will kick off our new sporadic series, Scottish Shenanigans. <br>

      <title>Episode 145: Lori Vallow Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[What a story this is, guys. Lori Vallow's saga is still going on and we seem to be no closer to answers than where it all started. In Part 2 of this crazy tale, we meet her husband Chad, we hear about his shady past and we wonder where the hell her children Tylee and JJ could be. Why is it that people around this couple tend to die or disappear? Is it bad luck or is a death cult? The questions keep piling up while the answer pile stays thin. Hopefully we will be able to update this episode soon with some good news or at least some closure. Step into Lori Vallow's world on mayhem, but don't say we didn't warn you. <br>

      <title>Episode 144: Zach Bowen And The Murder of Addie Hall Mega Mini Morbid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Well Alaina can't do it. She can't stay mini and she won't! Honestly, this was supposed to be a real mini but then I found another source and things got wild. Thanks for appreciating my lack of brevity on the regular, weirdos. <br>
<br>
This case is WILD. Zach Bowen and Addie Hall were two 20-somethings experiencing a whirlwind romance in New Orleans in the early 00s. Both had a free spirit way about them, they loved fiercely and they seemed to carve out a niche as the king and queen of the French Quarter misfits. But they both had a dark side and we all know everything done in the dark comes to the light eventually. This murder/suicide has twists, turns, romance, violence and worst of all, a truly tragic end for two people who could have lived, had they realized they needed to do that apart. <br>

      <title>Episode 143: Lori Vallow Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is a very recent and ongoing case that has baffled almost everyone who has heard of it. Lori Vallow made headlines in the end of 2019, when her two children, 17 year old Tylee and 8 year old JJ disappeared, seemingly into thin air. With reports circulating that she told witnesses stories like her children were long dead or staying with relatives who confirmed they were not, things look like they are going from bad to worse. But where are Tylee and JJ? Who is Lori Vallow and why has death and destruction followed her for years? In Part 1, Ash takes us through Lori Vallow's life, as well as her first 4 marriage and a possible murder. <br>

      <title>Episode 141: The Tragic Death of Kendrick Johnson</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Guys, this case has plagued us for years. It is one of those cases that provides more questions than it does answers. <br>
January 10, 2013, 17 year old Kendrick Johnson was found dead, rolled up in a wrestling mat in his high school gym. Initially, the case was quickly ruled a tragic, freak accident but after three autopsies, several false leads and a myriad of unanswered questions, Kendrick's family is no closer to finding out the truth about what happened to their son on that winter day in Georgia. Did Kendrick accidentally fall into a fatally inverted position in the rolled up mat? Or did someone put him there?<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Finally, we reach the Killer Clown. John Wayne Gacy murdered at least 33 young, teenaged boys during his reign on terror. As a beloved member of his community, an active member in several community groups and a bonafide clown named Pogo, no one could have known that he was spending most of his time luring, raping and murdering young boys. Part 1 will cover Gacy's life up until his first 2 murders.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[During the Summer Solstice of 1996,  Karina Holmer, a 20 year old nanny from Sweden was found brutally slain, severed in half at the waist in a dumpster in Boston. Was it her host family from the wealthy town of Dover, Ma? Was it the mysterious man with the dog? Was it a strange rocker who lived nearby? This unsolved case haunts Boston to this day. Tonight, we don't figure it out but we sure try.<br>

        <![CDATA[During the Summer Solstice of 1996,  Karina Holmer, a 20 year old nanny from Sweden was found brutally slain, severed in half at the waist in a dumpster in Boston. Was it her host family from the wealthy town of Dover, Ma? Was it the mysterious man with the dog? Was it a strange rocker who lived nearby? This unsolved case haunts Boston to this day. Tonight, we don't figure it out but we sure try.<br>

      <title>Episode 129: Kelly Anne Bates</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today's episode is a tough one, but it is one that we think is important to share. Kelly Anne Bates was a 14 year old child when she met a much older Dave Smith. While her parents helplessly looked on, she slipped further and further into his grasp until finally, he snuffed her out in one of the most gruesome murders to date. <br>
<br>
During this uncertain time, we know a lot of people have found themselves quarantined in a dangerous situation, quite possibly with their abusers. Kelly's story is an extreme case but it is a reality for those in abusive relationships. If you find yourself in trouble, here are some ways to reach out for help:<br>
<br>
Advocates at the National Domestic Violence Hotline are available 24/7 at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) in more than 200 languages.
<br>

Battered women’s support services 604-652-1867 or send us an email at intake@bwss.org
Call 604-687-1867 or 1-855-687-1868 or text 604-652-1867
<br>

Last week, local authorities in Spain and the Canary Islands have advised victims of abuse to go to their pharmacies and to use the code word ‘mask 19’ for help.
<br>

In the UK, the Independent Office for Police Conduct advises anyone who feels afraid of being overheard when dialing ‘999’ to listen to the questions from the phone operator, respond by coughing or tapping the handset if you can and press ‘55’.<br>

        <![CDATA[Today's episode is a tough one, but it is one that we think is important to share. Kelly Anne Bates was a 14 year old child when she met a much older Dave Smith. While her parents helplessly looked on, she slipped further and further into his grasp until finally, he snuffed her out in one of the most gruesome murders to date. <br>
<br>
During this uncertain time, we know a lot of people have found themselves quarantined in a dangerous situation, quite possibly with their abusers. Kelly's story is an extreme case but it is a reality for those in abusive relationships. If you find yourself in trouble, here are some ways to reach out for help:<br>
<br>
Advocates at the National Domestic Violence Hotline are available 24/7 at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233) in more than 200 languages.
<br>

Battered women’s support services 604-652-1867 or send us an email at intake@bwss.org
Call 604-687-1867 or 1-855-687-1868 or text 604-652-1867
<br>

Last week, local authorities in Spain and the Canary Islands have advised victims of abuse to go to their pharmacies and to use the code word ‘mask 19’ for help.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's an Ash Mini, guys! Because Alaina still has to work through the Covid19 pandemic, Ash took this one on and slayed the game. The brutal murders of James and Denise Closs and the horrific abduction of their daughter Jayme is something we probably all remember dominating the headlines in 2018. Luckily, the story has as good an ending as we can hope for in a tale like this one and Jayme emerged a warrior who used her strength and wits to survive and now thrive while her abductor Jake Patterson rots for the rest of his life. <br>

      <title>Episode 123: West Memphis 3 Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[BREVITY IS NOT MY STRONG SUIT.<br>
<br>
So here we are in Part 2 of our deep dive into the twisted tale of the West Memphis 3. In this episode we take a look into Damien, Jason and Jessie's lives as well as the confession that started it all. The West Memphis PD had their work cut out for them with the brutal mutilation and murders of 8 year olds, Christopher Byers, Michael Moore and Steven Branch but instead of rising to the occasion, they seemed to drown under the pressure.<br>

        <![CDATA[BREVITY IS NOT MY STRONG SUIT.<br>
<br>
So here we are in Part 2 of our deep dive into the twisted tale of the West Memphis 3. In this episode we take a look into Damien, Jason and Jessie's lives as well as the confession that started it all. The West Memphis PD had their work cut out for them with the brutal mutilation and murders of 8 year olds, Christopher Byers, Michael Moore and Steven Branch but instead of rising to the occasion, they seemed to drown under the pressure.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Paige Doherty was a sweet, beautiful, kind, hardworking young girl. At only 15 years old, she was working part time at a hair salon in Scotland hoping to one day become a stylist. It was on her way to this job one Saturday morning in March 2016, that she met a nightmarish end at the hands of John Leathem, human garbage pile. This is a tragic story but one where Paige's family has really done above and beyond to keep her memory alive and spare other families the grief they have dealt with alone.<br>

      <title>Episode 119: Dorian Corey: The Mummy In The Drag Queen's Closet</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Featured heavily in 1990's documentary on the Harlem drag ball scene, Dorian Corey was a legendary queen and an iconic performer. However, a dead man, partially mummified with a bullet in his head was found in her closet after her death in 1990 and instantly made her name synonymous with something decidedly less glamorous. What happened to this man? How did he get there? We may never know.<br>

      <title>Special Mini Morbid: A Chat With Jessica Clifton</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Today we got to have a truly humbling experience. We spoke with Jessica Clifton, the older sister of Maddie Clifton. Maddie was brutally murdered when she was only 8 years old and Jessica was only 11. Who was the killer? It was a casual friend in the neighborhood, 14 year old Joshua Philips. Speaking with Jessica, we were able to clear up some misconceptions about her sister's case and also hear her first hand experience as a family member of a murder victim. This conversation was really eye-opening and we want to thank Jessica a million times for sharing her insight with us. We know it wasn't easy to open this back up.<br>

      <title>Episode 110: What Happened To Alissa Turney?</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[17 year old Alissa Turney officially went missing May 17, 2001. Initially, she was labeled a runaway, but as evidence piled in to the contrary, the investigation seemed to point to foul play. Did her overbearing stepfather Michael Turney have something to do with Alissa's sudden disappearance? As the last person to see Alissa that day, he holds more answers than he is willing to give. Almost two decades later, the case remains unsolved and Alissa has never been found. <br>

      <title>Episode 109: The Mysterious Disappearance of Bryce Laspisa</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Man, this case is a roller coaster of frustration. 19 year old Bryce Laspisa suddenly changes during the first two weeks of his sophomore year in college according to his closest friends and girlfriend. One night in August, he took a road trip to nowhere that ended with his abandoned SUV at the bottom of an embankment and Bryce nowhere to be found. To this day, he has never been seen or heard from again. Did he end his life? Did he leave with intentions of never being found? Is he alive at all? The questions far outweigh the answers in this case but one thing is for sure, Bryce was going through something before he disappeared and it may be the one piece of information that could crack the case wide open.<br>

      <title>Episode 107: The Covina Christmas Eve Massacre</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Let's get completely out of any kind of holiday spirit by diving into a senseless and tragic murder of a family on Christmas Eve in 2008. Bruce Jeffrey Pardon was a true piece of human garbage and when he found himself divorced and unemployed, he took it out on those closest to him, in the most horrific way imaginable. <br>
<br>
EDIT: I mistakenly referred to Pardo's ex wife as Delilah, when in fact her name is Delia. <br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[This case is one that haunted me since I heard it in 2014. Jessica Chambers was a 19 year old, well liked girl from Courtland, Mississippi. When she was found with 98% of her body covered in burns, the mystery of her murder began. Today, her family and loved ones are still searching for some of the most important answers. Above all, who lit Jessica Chamber on fire? And why?<br>

      <title>Episode 103: Erika and Benjamin Sifrit, Natural Born Assholes Mini Morbid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In today's Alaina Mini Morbid, we meet two young lovers who somehow managed to take the film Natural Born Killers as an instructional video. Erika and Benjamin are not your average couple killers, if only for the fact that they didn't have a motive for their crimes. Their only aim was the thrill of the kill. Cold-blooded doesn't even begin to describe these two lizard people. <br>

      <title>Episode 101: Rodney Reed Mini Morbid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This case is one we planned to cover but has now become so time sensitive that we had to scrap our original Mini Morbid case for this week and do an emergency plea for everyone to check out the facts of this case and possibly take some action. <br>
Rodney Reed is accused of raping and murdering Stacey Stites in 1996, but the evidence definitely leads elsewhere. Now, Reed is set to be executed November 22nd for a crime he likely didn't commit. <br>

      <title>Episode 99: The Schoolbus Kidnapping of 1976</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Guys, this Alaina "Mini" Morbid is a doozy. How did we never know about this harrowing tale of 26 children and their heroic bus driver who survived over 24 hours of terror while being buried alive? Seriously, this one if intense but it has a happy ending that will leave you satisfied....at least somewhat satisfied. <br>

      <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
      <itunes:episode>99</itunes:episode>
      <itunes:summary>Guys, this Alaina "Mini" Morbid is a doozy. How did we never know about this harrowing tale of 26 children and their heroic bus driver who survived over 24 hours of terror while being buried alive? Seriously, this one if intense but it has a happy ending that will leave you satisfied....at least somewhat satisfied. &lt;br&gt;

So what better time for another solo science adventure with Alaina. Tonight, we discuss the science of fear. Why do some people love frightening things and others actively avoid them?

      <title>Episode 89: The Princes In The Tower Mini Morbid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's a historical mini! This week's tiny Morbid is a good old fashioned mystery/whodunit. After a long journey through the hellfire that was Dennis Rader, I think we can all use something lighter and possible politically charged murder is just the ticket. The Princes in the Tower takes us back to Tudor England when there was a real life game of thrones happening and sometimes things and often people got in the way of throne succession. <br>

      <title>Episode 80: The Murder of Maddie Clifton "Mini" Morbid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It's an Alaina Mini Morbid, which means it is longer than an average full length episode. Trust us, it is worth it because this case is a truly horrific but endlessly fascinating look into the mind of a secretly troubled young boy who fooled absolutely everyone in his life. Unfortunately, it was young, precious, vivacious Maddie Clifton was on the receiving end of his break from reality. <br>
*****TRIGGER WARNING*****<br>
This case involves the death of a child and it is hard to hear. We warn ahead of time when it will be discussed, so you can skip accordingly if you feel like you need to! <br>

      <title>Episode 73: The Mysterious Death of Phoebe Handsjuk Part 2</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[In our really long conclusion to this head scratcher, we can't promise a neatly tied up ending, but we can promise that you will be much better equipped to formulate your own thoughts about what happened the night that Phoebe Handsjuk met her tragic end. We discuss the night of her death further, the reactions of those closest to her and dive into the most bonkers police investigation and coroner's inquest that you could ever imagine. This is a crazy ride, mates. <br>

      <title>Episode 71: The Mysterious Death Of Phoebe Handsjuk Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[It’s another Australian madness episode!<br>
<br>

In this 2 part series, we will take a deep dive into the mysterious, gruesome and tragic death of Phoebe Handsjuk. The vibrant, beautiful and talented 23 year old died horrifically when she somehow plunged from a 12th floor garbage shoot in a luxury apartment building, all the way onto the bottom floor, where she passed through a compactor before being spat out in a scene straight out of a horror film.<br>
<br>

Part 1 will dissect her early life, her tumultuous relationship and her tragic death. Stay tuned for Part 2 where we go deeper into her death, the physics of it all and her family and friends’ never-ending mission to find out the truth.<br>

      <title>Episode 69: The Bloody Benders</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[This is just good, old western fun. By fun, we mean complete carnage and horror. Come back to the 1800s with us as we travel to early America’s humble beginnings where one family systematically butchered travelers who mistook their predatory existence for kindness. The Bloody Benders is a trip worth taking, but just don’t sit at the table when they forcibly suggest it to you. Don’t do it.<br>

      <title>Episode 68: The Murder of Angela Samota</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[I know we have slammed you with a couple of truly heavy cases and this one is definitely tough as well, but what sets this one apart is the ending. While it’s by no means a truly happy tale, there is a sense of satisfaction in the end.<br>
<br>

Angela Samota was a brilliant and vivacious college student whose life was tragically cut short when she was raped and murdered in her home in 1984. The investigation that follows takes some twists and turns before ending up at a shocking conclusion that proves no one can stop a determined best friend.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[This was an unexpected two-parter but the details of this absolutely bonkers and tragic tale were too fascinating to neglect. In Part 1 we cover the downward spiral of 12 year-old Jasmine Richardson and her plummet into darkness after meeting self professed 300 year-old werewolf, Jeremy Steinke. We end this first part with the tragic murders of Jasmine’s family. Fair warning, there is a child involved in this horrific case.<br>

        <![CDATA[This was an unexpected two-parter but the details of this absolutely bonkers and tragic tale were too fascinating to neglect. In Part 1 we cover the downward spiral of 12 year-old Jasmine Richardson and her plummet into darkness after meeting self professed 300 year-old werewolf, Jeremy Steinke. We end this first part with the tragic murders of Jasmine’s family. Fair warning, there is a child involved in this horrific case.<br>

      <title>Episode 53: Part 1 Karla Homolka &amp; Paul Bernardo “The Ken and Barbie Killers”</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Canadians, you know this case all too well. It is vile, horrific and unjust to say the least. Karla Homolka and her husband Paul Bernardo AKA "The Scarborough Rapist" terrorized and murdered young women in Ontario during the late 80s/early 90s, including Karla's own younger sister, until they were finally stopped and locked up for good....at least one of them was. In this two part investigation into their life and crimes, things are definitely going to get uncomfortable and disturbing. So, listener beware. We will give plenty of warning when things are going to get brutal.<br>

      <title>Episode 49: Public Executions &amp; The Psychology of Watching Pain Mini Morbid</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[So, Alaina isn't great at brevity. Her Mini Morbid covers the history of public executions and explores why people have always loved them. Have we evolved as a species away from gathering to watch someone be hanged in the town square? This is a long Mini that will have you thinking about a lot of things. Hold on to your butts....and maybe your heads.
As a ***WARNING*** this episode contains a short history of lynching in the United States. This subject is horrifying and can be triggering to some. Just be aware and use your judgement but we announce the topic before we delve into it.

        <![CDATA[This guy somehow flies under the radar a lot but don't be fooled, he is a prolific and brutal serial killer who seemed to have taken his MO directly from the pages of "The Most Dangerous Game"(never confirmed but...come on...). In part 1 of our two part series on this trash human, we will discuss Hansen's teen years, his brushes with the law and take a dive into his first few murders. He's a treat, guys. Strap in.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[In today's Mini Morbid, Alaina has chosen to take a brain trip to Scotland to dissect their history with witch trials. This episode will give a short background on the Scottish witch trials of the 1500s -1700s but mainly focus on one trial in particular from 1696 that revolved around a bold little girl, a stolen cup of milk and some poor souls who paid the ultimate price for it. Hope you enjoy.<br>

        <![CDATA[It is Christmas day in 1929 and Charles Lawson is feeling some type of way. Unintentional poetry aside, the mystery of one man's actions that left his entire family brutally butchered, save for his eldest son who he intentionally sent away from the scene before the carnage, has fascinated and horrified true crime fans for decades. Why did Charles Lawson annihilate his family on Christmas morning? Why did he sent Arthur away before the rampage? Why did Marie put raisins on the damn cake? The questions and the brutality are overflowing in this case, so join us while we speculate wildly.  <br>

      <title>Episode 27: The Survival Story of Mary Vincent, Patron Saint of Badassery</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Mary Vincent survived something so horrifying that most of us couldn't even conjure it up in our nightmares. Her attacker, Lawrence Singleton, could have never imagined that Mary would walk away from where he left her to die in a canyon as a symbol of strength and resilience in the face of insurmountable odds. This is a story of survival, but also one of a justice system that is in desperate need of fixing.<br>

      <title>Episode 17: Rod Ferrell “The Vampire Cult Killer” AKA Turbo Douche</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Rod Ferrell was a special kind of jerk. Convinced he was a 500 year old vampire named Vesago living in a 16 year old boy's body, he took his otherworldly fantasies to the brink by carrying out two senseless, brutal murders. He didn't just kill anyone, though. By his own admission, he murdered the parents of one of his cult followers for the rush of it. Does he care? Nope. Does he still think he is a 500 year old vampire? Yup. This one is a trip, guys.<br>

      <title>Episode 16: The Lake Bodom Murders</title>
      <description>

      <title>Episode 14: Richard “Stanky Chops” Ramirez AKA “The Nightstalker”</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Richard Ramirez was the worst human to be spat onto Earth in a long time. Between the years of 1984 and 1985, he terrorized the residents of Los Angeles and surrounding areas by creeping through unlocked windows and doors in the dead of night to rape, assault, torture and murder whoever was unfortunate enough to be sleeping inside. In Part 1 of our two part series on this demon turd, we take a look at his early life and the beginnings of his ride into infamy. Lock your windows, guys. Fresh air is for dead people.<br>

      <title>Episode 9: The Axeman of New Orleans AKA A Real Crumb</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Gather 'round you cats and chicks and moldy figs. We are about to take a trip in the way back machine to a time when New Orleans was more known for influenza than for beads. In 1918 (possibly 1911 but that's debatable), a jazzy, caguely poetic monster was demanding New Orleaneans play his favorite jazz tunes or he would take his axe to their noggins. It was all very bizarre and that's the way we like it. So, join us for The Axeman of New Orleans, ya bunch of barn burners.<br>

      <title>Episode 5: Ted Bundy Part 1</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Theodore Robert Bundy confessed to the brutal slayings of 36 female coeds. Experts believe his tally could climb into the 100s. Ted stands high above the rest of his kind as the most infamous and the most brutal. To this day, his charm and methods have been unmatched. Heard of a little film called "Silence of the Lambs"? Buffalo Bill's penchant for preying on the kindness of his female victims and utilizing a fake arm cast to up the pathetic quotient was ripped directly from Mr. Bundy's modus operandi. Part 1 of this bananas tale will set it up for a truly terrifying crescendo.

        <![CDATA[This one is a real head scratcher. This week, we head into the mountains of Siberia to dissect the bizarre tale of 9 dead Russian hikers, 1 missing tongue and a possible Yeti siege back in 1959. The case has never been completely closed and although a lot of questions remain unanswered, there are organizations that don’t seem to want to reveal the truth. Strap in, because it’s about to get chilly and conspiracy theorist-y in here.<br>

      <title>Episode 2: Edmund Kemper “The Coed Killer” &amp; Chatty Cathy</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Oh, Edmund. This guy could have been something great if he had just ignored the part of his psyche that implored him to kill and dismember young women in order to have quality time with them. With an IQ well above average and a penchant for flowery prose, he unfortunately grew up in an environment that nourished violence and hatred for himself and those around him. Buckle up, Edmund is a real nasty character, but he will tell you that himself.<br>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[Alaina is an autopsy technician with a passion for science, true crime and all things creepy. Ashleigh is a hair stylist who may look glamorous on the outside, but houses spooky core.
Now that this bad Larry has been identified, it seemed like a perfect debut episode. Come take a look through the crimes and capture of Joseph James DeAngelo AKA The Golden State Killer, The East Area Rapist, The Diamond Knot Killer and The Original Nightstalker. He may have began his reign of terror way back in 1976 but he was able to continue it for four decades before pesky familial DNA was able to take him down. Isn't science great?
