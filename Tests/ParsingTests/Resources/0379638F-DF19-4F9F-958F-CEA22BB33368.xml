      <itunes:subtitle>In Acts 22, Paul's testimony falls on hostile Roman ears, and he narrowly escapes scourging by way of his Roman citizenship. Reflecting on this incident, Fr. Mike reminds us that God uses Paul's past to further his ministry, and that God does the same with each of us, today. Commenting on today's readings from 2 Corinthians, Fr. Mike highlights that we are called to be cheerful givers and disciplined thinkers. He also points out that, as Paul reminds us, the most important ministry credential is to be called by God and equipped by his grace. Today's readings are Acts 22, 2 Corinthians 9-11, and Proverbs 29:5-7. </itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>As we draw near to the end of the Gospel of Luke, Fr. Mike briefly expands on the story of the poor widow’s offering, emphasizing that the Lord cares more about the size of our hearts than about the size of our gifts. Fr. Mike also underscores Jesus’ moving words to Peter when he foretells Peter’s denial. Jesus’ words remind us that no matter how fiercely the enemy tries to attack us, he is always praying for each and every one of us. Today's readings are Luke 20-22:38 and Proverbs 26:17-19.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike elaborates on the significance of the Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan River. He points out that the location of the Jordan River is particularly noteworthy because it's the same river that Joshua crossed over to lead the Israelites into the Promised Land, signifying that Jesus will bring about a new exodus. Additionally, it's the lowest spot on the planet, symbolizing Jesus' humility. Finally, Fr. Mike emphasizes that when we are baptized, we are adopted as beloved sons and daughters of God because what belongs to Jesus by his nature is given to us by God’s grace. Today we read Luke 3-5 and Proverbs 25:27-28.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike breaks down the doctrine of purgatory as we read about Judas Maccabeus and his army praying for the dead in 2 Maccabees 12. We learn that purgatory is a process of purification that our hearts need in order to be ready to love God and to enter into his presence. In our reading of Wisdom today, Fr. Mike emphasizes the insanity of worshipping idols and how it's more tempting to make idols out of good things rather than evil things. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 12, Wisdom 13-14, and Proverbs 25:11-14.</itunes:subtitle>

He also engages with the riddles found in Wisdom 10 and points out that we can now not only understand the characters, stories, and allusions of Scripture, but can recognize the fingerprints of God in the world around us and better understand the main character of Scripture: God. Today’s readings are 2 Maccabees 10, Wisdom 9-10, and Proverbs 25:4-7.</p>

In the story of the martyrdom of the seven brothers in 2 Macabees, we see how the brothers and their mother fiercely reject the temptation to violate God's law, and boldly hold onto their hope in the resurrection of the dead. Our readings from Wisdom also remind us that death is not the end, because we know that eternal life is waiting for us beyond death. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 7, Wisdom 3-4, and Proverbs 24:27-29.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike walks us through the signing of the covenant in Nehemiah 10 and relates Israel’s collective decision to belong to God to our personal encounters with God that inspire us to follow him simply because he has called us. He also offers insight on how God used the physical weakness of Esther to move the king’s heart to gentleness. Today’s readings are Nehemiah 10, Esther 15, 6-7, and Proverbs 21:13-16.</itunes:subtitle>

Mike walks us through the signing of the covenant in Nehemiah 10 and relates Israel’s collective decision to belong to God to our personal encounters with God that inspire us to follow him simply because he has called us. He also offers insight on how God used the physical weakness of Esther to move the king’s heart to gentleness. Today’s readings are Nehemiah 10, Esther 15, 6-7, and Proverbs 21:13-16.

        <![CDATA[<p>Reflecting on the stubbornness of the Israelites&#39; hearts from today&#39;s readings, Fr. Mike teaches us that we cannot always trust our imperfect hearts, because they are not always aligned God&#39;s law and will, and they can often lead us into false worship. However, we can rely on God who promises to give us a new heart so that we can do what we ought. Today&#39;s readings are Jeremiah 7, Ezekiel 36, and Proverbs 14:29-32.</p>

He emphasizes how good shepherds are willing to face the truth, and also sacrifice for their sheep, like Jesus who laid down his life for us. In our reading of Jeremiah, Fr.

Cyrus not only shows us that no soul is ever too far for God's grace, but that God makes all things new, and is able to bring beautiful blessings from the most desperate situations. Today's readings are Isaiah 45-46, Ezekiel 6-7, and Proverbs 12:9-12.</itunes:subtitle>

In a broken world, we are sometimes going to be called to fight the brokenness around us, but we must believe that God is allowing this not because he likes war, but because something better will come in its place.

Today&#39;s readings are 2 Kings 8, Hosea 8-10, and Psalm 108.</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike emphasizes the importance of knowing God and knowing his love for us as we read about the devastation of war and the lack of faith displayed by Israel. Without a deeper knowledge of God, not only can we struggle for hope in God's plan, but we can also fall into the temptation of losing faith in him altogether. Today's readings are 2 Kings 6-7, Hosea 4-7, and Psalm 103.</itunes:subtitle>

We also hear more about Barnabas, missionary companion of St. Paul, who was named by God as the &quot;Son of Encouragement.&quot; Lastly, Fr.

Additionally, it's the lowest spot on the planet, symbolizing Jesus' humility. Finally, Fr.

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike breaks down the doctrine of purgatory as we read about Judas Maccabeus and his army praying for the dead in 2 Maccabees 12. We learn that purgatory is a process of purification that our hearts need in order to be ready to love God and to enter into his presence. In our reading of Wisdom today, Fr. Mike emphasizes the insanity of worshipping idols and how it's more tempting to make idols out of good things rather than evil things. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 12, Wisdom 13-14, and Proverbs 25:11-14.</itunes:subtitle>

        <![CDATA[<p>Fr. Mike breaks down the doctrine of purgatory as we read about Judas Maccabeus and his army praying for the dead in 2 Maccabees 12. We learn that purgatory is a process of purification that our hearts need in order to be ready to love God and to enter into his presence. In our reading of Wisdom today, Fr. Mike emphasizes the insanity of worshipping idols and how it&#39;s more tempting to make idols out of good things rather than evil things. Today&#39;s readings are 2 Maccabees 12, Wisdom 13-14, and Proverbs 25:11-14.</p>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike focuses on the powerful theme that connects all of our readings today- the reality of life beyond death. In the story of the martyrdom of the seven brothers in 2 Macabees, we see how the brothers and their mother fiercely reject the temptation to violate God's law, and boldly hold onto their hope in the resurrection of the dead. Our readings from Wisdom also remind us that death is not the end, because we know that eternal life is waiting for us beyond death. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 7, Wisdom 3-4, and Proverbs 24:27-29.</itunes:subtitle>

In the story of the martyrdom of the seven brothers in 2 Macabees, we see how the brothers and their mother fiercely reject the temptation to violate God's law, and boldly hold onto their hope in the resurrection of the dead. Our readings from Wisdom also remind us that death is not the end, because we know that eternal life is waiting for us beyond death. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 7, Wisdom 3-4, and Proverbs 24:27-29.

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike offers a recap of Eleazar's martyrdom and marvels at Eleazar's courage to avoid both sin, and the temptation to  lead others into sin.  As we begin reading the book of Wisdom today, we also learn three valuable lessons;  God did not create death, death entered the world through sin, and we are wise when we walk in the truth but foolish when we walk in evil. Today's readings are 2 Maccabees 6, Wisdom 1-2, and Proverbs 24:21-26.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike explains how God’s favor was with  Ezra because he set his heart to study God's laws, to obey his laws, and to teach his laws to others. We also learn about hypocritical fasting, and how our sacrifices should remind us that everything ultimately belongs to God at all times. Today's readings are Ezra 7-8, Zechariah 7-8, and Proverbs 20:12-15.

      <itunes:subtitle>Fr. Mike focuses on the concept of being rich in love instead of rich in wealth today, as we read about the heart of a mother and father in our verse from Proverbs.

        <![CDATA[<p>Fr. Mike explains the significance behind the mention of bones in Jeremiah and Ezekiel.  In Jeremiah, we learn that the bones of God&#39;s people are scattered because of their worship of false gods. In Ezekiel, we see the prophet prophesy over the valley of dry bones and the Lord’s Spirit restoring and moving within them. Today’s readings are Jeremiah 8, Ezekiel 37-38, and Proverbs 14:33-35.</p>

Cyrus not only shows us that no soul is ever too far for God's grace, but that God makes all things new, and is able to bring beautiful blessings from the most desperate situations. Today's readings are Isaiah 45-46, Ezekiel 6-7, and Proverbs 12:9-12.</itunes:subtitle>

In a broken world, we are sometimes going to be called to fight the brokenness around us, but we must believe that God is allowing this not because he likes war, but because something better will come in its place. Today's readings are Isaiah 16-17, Joel 3, and Proverbs 10:21-24.</itunes:subtitle>

        <![CDATA[<p>As we conclude the book of Amos, we hear Amos rebuke the people for grudgingly giving their time to God, as in prayer or on the sabbath, and counting the minutes until they could do whatever they wanted. Fr. Mike points out that if we don&#39;t give our hearts and minds to God, we won&#39;t be able to stand heaven, where prayer and praise are everlasting. The readings are 2 Kings 13-14, Amos 7-9, and Psalm 124.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Fr. Mike emphasizes the importance of knowing God and knowing his love for us as we read about the devastation of war and the lack of faith displayed by Israel. Without a deeper knowledge of God, not only can we struggle for hope in God&#39;s plan, but we can also fall into the temptation of losing faith in him altogether. Today&#39;s readings are 2 Kings 6-7, Hosea 4-7, and Psalm 103.</p>

He also explains the role of the gatekeepers as people who would be responsible for guarding the doors to the Temple. The readings are 2 Samuel 21, 1 Chronicles 26, and Psalm 40.</p>
