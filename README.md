# swift-podcast-parser

XML parsing is messy, especially RSS and more spefically podcast feeds. The swift-podcast-parser package composes a bidirectional parser for podcast feeds on top of [swift-parsing](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing) aiming to find a solid balance between correctness and tolerance.

## Tests
